It boasts wide compatibility with the Fabric mod ecosystem when compared to other rendering-focused mods, and it does so without compromising on how the game looks, giving you that authentic block game feel.\n<h1 id=\"installation\">📥 Installation Guide</h1>\n\n**Please make sure you read the <a href=\"https://github.com/CaffeineMC/sodium-fabric/wiki/Driver-Compatibility\">Driver Compatibility</a> section on our wiki before you install Sodium. It contains important instructions on how to prevent crashes and other performance problems.**\n\nSodium is a Fabric mod, which means it requires the [Fabric Loader](https://fabricmc.net/use). If you are using a third-party launcher, it probably has built-in functionality to automatically install mod loaders. Once you have installed Fabric Loader, you can simply place Sodium into your _mods folder_ like anything else.\n\nSome other mods (notably those which require Fabric API) may also require that [Indium](https://modrinth.com/mod/indium) is installed alongside Sodium.\n\n**Not sure if you installed the mod correctly?** Check your _Video Settings_ screen in Minecraft, which should show our new and improved user interface for changing settings.\n\n**Not sure how to configure the mod?** Don't worry, you probably don't need to. By default, Sodium will enable all optimizations which are supported on your system, giving you the best experience possible. You should generally only change video settings related to performance and other advanced features if you are experiencing issues.\n\n**Need even more performance?** By design, Sodium only optimizes the rendering code of Minecraft. You should also install our other mods, such as [Lithium](https://modrinth.com/mod/lithium) (for MC 1.15+) and [Phosphor](https://modrinth.com/mod/phosphor) (for MC <1.19), to optimize the other parts of your game. This is done so that players can pick and choose which mods they want to use, but we generally recommend using [our entire collection](https://modrinth.com/user/jellysquid3).\n\n<h1 id=\"hardware-compatibility\">✅ Hardware Compatibility</h1>\n\nWe only support graphics cards which have up-to-date drivers that are compatible with OpenGL 4.6. Most graphics cards released in the past 12 years are compatible. This includes the following hardware:\n\n- INTEL HD Graphics 500 Series (Skylake) or newer\n- NVIDIA GeForce 400 Series (Fermi) or newer\n- AMD Radeon HD 7000 Series (GCN 1) or newer\n \nIn some cases, older graphics cards may also work (so long as they have up-to-date drivers which have support for OpenGL 3.3), but they are not officially supported, and may not be compatible with future versions of Sodium.\n\nAndroid devices which use OpenGL translation layers (such as GL4ES, ANGLE, etc) are not supported and will very likely not work with Sodium. These translation layers do not implement required functionality and they suffer from underlying driver bugs which cannot be worked around.\n\nIf you are running into problems, you should make sure that your graphics drivers are up-to-date. Out-of-date graphics drivers are often the reason for most crashes, rendering bugs, and performance issues.\n\n# 🐛 How to Report Issues\n\nPlease use the [issue tracker](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/sodium-fabric/issues) linked at the top of the page to report bugs, crashes, and other issues. Make sure you include information about the mods you are using, and attach any crash/log files you have.\n\n# ❓ Frequently Asked Questions\n\nWe have a short wiki with some of the most frequently asked questions [here](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/caffeine-meta/wiki/FAQ). More likely than not, your question already has an answer here.\n\n# ⚙️ Technical details\n\nSo, how exactly does Sodium work? We obviously cannot just say that the game is magically faster without providing some kind of explanation. The following list tries to cover some of the most significant changes which are responsible for our performance improvements, but it's not complete or exhaustive of everything Sodium does.\n\n- We replace all of Minecraft's world rendering code with our own implementation that is built upon modern rendering techniques. For chunk rendering, we make use of _geometry batching_ and _draw pass consolidation_, which greatly reduces the amount of CPU overhead involved in rendering the world. Sodium isn't just an optimization mod... it's more like a rendering engine.\n\n- We use a much more compact format for world geometry, which allows for up to a ~40% reduction in the amount of video memory used by chunks. Additionally, we make use of a second culling pass to eliminate geometry which is facing away from the camera (but still within the camera's view) so that the GPU does not need to process hidden geometry. Together, these optimizations reduce video memory bandwidth requirements significantly, which is one of the game's biggest bottlenecks.\n\n- We use a fully-rewritten system for generating chunk geometry, including the biome colorization, lighting, and shading passes. This is often much faster than the vanilla code, which helps to make chunk loading faster and less CPU-intensive. ([before](https://streamable.com/3taw22), [after](https://streamable.com/4pesh2))\n\n- We use a custom threading implementation which ensures chunk updates are better able to take advantage of multi-core CPUs, which greatly reduces the lag spikes that are caused by placing/breaking blocks. ([before](https://streamable.com/lm5sp5), [after](https://streamable.com/nsdl0r))\n\n- We've written many optimizations for vertex building and transformation, which helps to speed up immediate-mode rendering. This noticeably improves performance in heavy scenes, such as when many entities are visible.\n\n- We've made numerous improvements to how the game manages memory and allocates objects, which in turn reduces memory consumption and lag spikes caused by garbage collector activity.\n\n- Animated textures which are not visible in the world are not updated, speeding up texture updating on most hardware (especially AMD cards.)\n\nMany people are used to performance optimization meaning that the game will look worse, but in our case, we actually improve the graphical fidelity of Minecraft in most situations.\n\n- Biome colors for blocks and fluids are smoothed across block faces, providing greatly improved graphical quality that is significantly less computationally intensive.  ([comparison](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/AANobbMI/images/6b0e58705156ba67a6d97a74b9f9ac05da69f502.webp))\n\n- Smooth lighting now works correctly on fluids and other special blocks ([comparison](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/AANobbMI/images/d84313e6f57dc9e7896961dbd2dfc2689d482758.webp)) We also fix a number of graphical issues with block shading ([comparison](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/AANobbMI/images/56c4599efcb529a19aed0e118caad4178d7fd540.webp)) which helps to make everything look smoother.",

[Website.](https://tr7zw.github.io/project/entityculling/)\n\nMinecraft skips rendering things that are behind you, so why is it rendering everything that you still can't see because of a wall in the way? This mod utilizes your other CPU cores/threads to do really quick path-tracing from your camera to all block/-entities to determine rather they are visible or not. During the rendering, the not visible ones will be skipped the same way entities behind you are.\n\n[![Shockbyte](https://tr7zw.dev/img/shockbyte_black.png?v=2)](https://shockbyte.com//partner/tr7zw)\n\n## Dependencies\n\n- none\n\n## Incompatible\n\n- none (With some mods you might need to add the blocks to the config whitelist to fix visual issues)\n\n## Tested with\n\n- Sodium\n- Iris\n- Optifine\n \n## Note to why it works even with Sodium/Optifine\n\nThis has been tested with other mods, Optifine(Optifabric), Iris, and Sodium, in all cases resulting in fps gains in places like Game Server lobbies.\n\nYou might wonder why it does increase the FPS with Sodium since Sodium has \"Use Entity Culling\" in its Advanced settings and enabled by default. The difference is that Sodium does a really quick pass based on the visible chunks, being way less aggressive and thereby still rendering entities that just happen to be in visible chunks, but not visible themselves.\n\n## FAQ\n\n### Does this have to be installed on the Server?\n\nNo, this is fully Client-side and can't be installed on servers.\n\n### Will this influence farms/mobs?\n\nNo. Since this mod just skips the rendering, mobs will still spawn/move/drop items.\n\n## Credits\n\nRoboTricker created the original server-side async raytracing occlusion culling implementation for Transport-Pipes.",

          "body": "# Mod Menu\n![Screenshot of the Mods screen, showing a list of a few mods on the left side below a search bar and filters button, where Mod Menu is selected. On the right side of the screen, it shows more details about the mod, such as authors, a description, links, credits, and a button to configure the mod.](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/mOgUt4GM/images/155dd2b006883b168b1279ec0ff21e753946518b.png)\n\nMod Menu lets you view the mods you have installed and, if supported by the mod, enables quick and easy access to the mod's config screens.\n\nMod Menu also supports some more advanced features, such as translatable mod names and descriptions, support for [QuickText formatting](https://placeholders.pb4.eu/user/quicktext/) in mod descriptions thanks to [Patbox](https://ko-fi.com/patbox)'s [Text Placeholder API](https://modrinth.com/mod/placeholder-api), filters library mods out from regular mods, a mod update checker for mods hosted on Modrinth or that provide their own update sources, and deep configuration for all the features we provide.\n\n### Supported Platforms\nMod Menu is currently available for Fabric or Quilt on Minecraft: Java Edition 1.14 or newer.\n\n## Developers\nMod Menu includes a number of APIs for developers to improve how their mod appears in Mod Menu. These come in the form of language keys, JSON metadata, and even a Java API.\n\n### Translation API\nYou can translate your mod's name, summary, and description all without touching any Java code. Simply add translation keys in the supported format to any language you'd like.\n\n<details>\n<summary>Translation API Documentation</summary>\n\nHere's an example of Mod Menu's translations into Pirate Speak. To create your own, simply replace `modmenu` at the end (***NOT*** the one in the beginning) of the translation key with your own mod ID, for example `modmenu.descriptionTranslation.traverse`.\n\n`en_pt.json`\n```json\n\"modmenu.nameTranslation.modmenu\": \"Menu o' mods!\",\n\"modmenu.descriptionTranslation.modmenu\": \"Menu o' mods ye installed matey!\",\n\"modmenu.summaryTranslation.modmenu\": \"Menu o' mods ye installed matey!\"\n```\n\n> The summary translation is redundant here and does not need to be included because it's the same as the description, but it was included to show that you may translate the summary (a short, one-sentence description of the mod) separately from the description, even in English!\n\n</details>\n\n\n\n### Fabric Metadata API\nThere's a number of things you can add just with metadata in your `fabric.mod.json`.\n\nAll of these are added to a custom block in your `fabric.mod.json` for Mod Menu's metadata. Here's an example usage of many of the features this API provides:\n\n`fabric.mod.json`\n```json5\n{\n  ...\n  \"custom\": {\n    \"modmenu\": {\n      \"links\": {\n        \"modmenu.discord\": \"https://discord.gg/jEGF5fb\"\n      },\n      \"badges\": [ \"library\", \"deprecated\" ],\n      \"parent\": {\n        \"id\": \"example-api\",\n        \"name\": \"Example API\",\n        \"description\": \"Modular example library\",\n        \"icon\": \"assets/example-api-module-v1/parent_icon.png\",\n        \"badges\": [ \"library\" ]\n      },\n      \"update_checker\": true\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n<details>\n<summary>Fabric Metadata API Documentation</summary>\n\n#### Badges (`\"badges\": [ ]`)\nWhile the `Client` badge is added automatically to mods set as client-side only (set `\"environment\": \"client\"` in `fabric.mod.json` to do this.), other badges such as the `Library` and `Deprecated` badges require definition here.\n\nSupported values:\n- `library` - should be assigned to mods that are purely dependencies for other mods that should not be shown to the user by default unless they toggle them on.\n- `deprecated` - should be assigned to mods that exist purely for legacy reasons, such as an old API module or such.\n\nAny others will be ignored, and Mod Menu does not support adding your own badges. You may open an issue [here](https://github.com/TerraformersMC/ModMenu/issues) if you have a compelling use case for a new badge.\n\n#### Links (`\"links\": { }`)\nThe `links` object allows mod authors to add custom hyperlinks to the end of their description. If you specify a `sources` contact in the official `fabric.mod.json` metadata, it will also be included in the links section.\n\nAny key in the `links` object will be included in the links section, with the key being used as a translation key. For example, this:\n\n`fabric.mod.json`\n```json\n\"custom\": {\n    \"modmenu\": {\n        \"links\": {\n          \"modmenu.discord\": \"https://discord.gg/jEGF5fb\"\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\nwill show as a link with the text \"Discord\", since \"Discord\" is the English translation of \"modmenu.discord\" provided by Mod Menu.\n\nMod Menu provides several default translations that can be used for links. A full list can be seen in Mod Menu's language file [here](https://github.com/TerraformersMC/ModMenu/blob/-/src/main/resources/assets/modmenu/lang/en_us.json). All default link translation keys take the form `modmenu.<type>`.\n\nYou can also provide your own translations if you would like to add custom links. Make sure to use ***your own namespace*** (as opposed to `modmenu`) for any custom keys.\n\n#### Parents (`\"parent\": \"mod_id\" or { }`)\n<img align=\"right\" width=\"400\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/ZutCprf.png\">\n\nParents are used to display a mod as a child of another one. This is meant to be used for mods divided into different modules. The following element in a `fabric.mod.json` will define the mod as a child of the mod 'flamingo': \n\n`fabric.mod.json`\n```json\n\"custom\": {\n    \"modmenu\": {\n        \"parent\": \"flamingo\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\nHowever, if you want to group mods under a parent, but the parent isn't an actual mod, you can do that too. In the example below, a mod is defining metadata for a parent. Make sure that this metadata is included in all of the children that use the fake/dummy parent. This can also be used as a fallback for an optional parent, it will be replace by the mod's real metadata if present.\n\n\n`fabric.mod.json`\n```json\n\"custom\": {\n    \"modmenu\": {\n        \"parent\": {\n            \"id\": \"this-mod-isnt-real\",\n            \"name\": \"Fake Mod\",\n            \"description\": \"Do cool stuff with this fake mod\",\n            \"icon\": \"assets/real-mod/fake-mod-icon.png\",\n            \"badges\": [ \"library\" ]\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nDummy parent mods only support the following metadata:\n- `id` (String)\n- `name` (String)\n- `description` (String)\n- `icon` (String)\n- `badges` (Array of Strings)\n\n\n#### Disable update checker (`\"update_checker\": false`)\nBy default, Mod Menu's update checker will use the hash of your mod's jar to lookup the latest version on Modrinth. If it finds a matching project, it will check for the latest version that supports your mod loader and Minecraft version, and if it has a different hash from your existing file, it will prompt the user that there is an update available.\n\nYou can disable the update checker by setting `update_checker` to false in your Mod Menu metadata like so:\n\n`fabric.mod.json`\n```json\n\"custom\": {\n    \"modmenu\": {\n        \"update_checker\": false\n    }\n}\n```\n\n</details>\n\n### Quilt Metadata API\nSince Mod Menu supports Quilt as well, the same APIs in the Fabric Metadata API section are also available for Quilt mods, but the format for custom metadata is slightly different. \n\nInstead of a `\"modmenu\"` block inside of a `\"custom\"` block, you put the `\"modmenu\"` block as an element in the root object. So it should look like:\n\n`quilt.mod.json`\n```json5\n{\n  ...\n  \"modmenu\": {\n    // Here's where your links, badges, etc. stuff goes\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Java API\nTo use the Java API, you'll need to add Mod Menu as a compile-time dependency in your gradle project. This won't make your mod require Mod Menu, but it'll be present in your environment for you to test with.\n\n`build.gradle`\n```gradle\n// Add the Terraformers maven repo to your repositories block\nrepositories {\n  maven {\n    name = \"Terraformers\"\n    url = \"https://maven.terraformersmc.com/\"\n  }\n}\n\n// Add Mod Menu as a dependency in your environment\ndependencies {\n  modImplementation(\"com.terraformersmc:modmenu:${project.modmenu_version}\")\n}\n```\nThen, define the version of Mod Menu you're using in your `gradle.properties`. You can get the latest version number [here](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu/version/latest), but you may need a different version if you're not using the latest Minecraft version. See the [versions page](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu/versions) for a full list of versions.\n\n`gradle.properties`\n```properties\nmodmenu_version=VERSION_NUMBER_HERE\n```\n> If you don't want it in your environment for testing but still want to compile against Mod Menu for using the Java API, you can use `modCompileOnly` instead of `modImplementation` (this will work even if Mod Menu is not updated to the version of Minecraft you're running).\n\n<details>\n<summary>Java API Documentation</summary>\n\n### Getting Started\nTo use the API, implement the ModMenuApi interface on a class and add that as an entry point of type \"modmenu\" in your `fabric.mod.json` like this:\n\n`fabric.mod.json`\n```json\n\"entrypoints\": {\n  \"modmenu\": [ \"com.example.mod.ExampleModMenuApiImpl\" ]\n}\n```\n\n### Mod Config Screens\nMods can provide a Screen factory to provide a custom config screen to open with the config button. Implement the `getModConfigScreenFactory` method in your API implementation to do this.\n\nThe intended use case for this is for mods to provide their own config screens. The mod id of the config screen is automagically determined by the source mod container that the entrypoint originated from.\n\n### Provided Config Screens\nMods can provide Screen factories to provide a custom config screens to open with the config buttons for other mods as well. Implement the `getProvidedConfigScreenFactories` method in your API implementation for this.\n\nThe intended use case for this is for a mod like Cloth Config to provide config screens for mods that use its API.\n\n### Modpack Badges\nMods can give other mods the `Modpack` badge by implementing the `attachModpackBadges` method, such as through the following:\n\n```java\n@Override\npublic void attachModpackBadges(Consumer<String> consumer) {\n\tconsumer.accept(\"modmenu\"); // Indicates that 'modmenu' is part of the modpack\n}\n```\n\nNote that 'internal' mods such as Minecraft itself and the mod loader cannot be given the modpack badge, as they are not distributed within a typical modpack.\n\n### Static Helper Methods\n`ModMenuApi` also offers a few helper methods for mods that want to work with Mod Menu better, like making their own Mods buttons.\n\n#### Creating a Mods screen instance\nYou can call this method to get an instance of the Mods screen:\n```java\nScreen createModsScreen(Screen previous)\n```\n\n#### Creating a Mods button `Text`\nYou can call this method to get the Text that would be displayed on a Mod Menu Mods button:\n```java\nText createModsButtonText()\n```\n\n</details>",

          "body": "Lithium is a modern, general-purpose optimization mod for Minecraft which works to improve a number of systems (game physics, mob AI, block ticking, etc) with the goal of **not changing any vanilla mechanics**. \n\n<br>\n\nThe mod works **on both the client and server**, and can be installed on servers **without requiring clients to also have the mod** (and vice versa.)\n\n<br>\n\nFor multiplayer servers, administrators can expect a sizeable improvement to tick times, allowing their hardware to support more loaded entities, chunks, and players. Even in single-player, Lithium helps to improve performance by optimizing the internal game server, which is used for \"ticking\" the world. This can free up your computer's processor to focus on other tasks, resulting in **improved frame rates and increased responsiveness**. \n\n\n<br>\n\n\nThe strict goal of maintaining exact behavior with vanilla makes Lithium suitable for almost any Minecraft server running Fabric, even for highly complex gameplay scenarios and creations. In fact, our continued insistence towards not changing vanilla gameplay has even led to the mod being officially allowed in [Minecraft speedrunning](https://www.speedrun.com/mc).\n\n<br>\n\n## Installation\n\nMake sure you have the latest version of Fabric Loader present and then simply drop the mod into your mods folder. No other mods or additional setup (not even Fabric API!) is required. You do not need to create new worlds in order to take advantage of the mod.\n\n<br>\n\n\nWhile you're at it, you may want to check out two of my other mods, [Phosphor](https://modrinth.com/mod/phosphor) and [Sodium](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium), as they're both fully compatible and only help to further improve performance in different parts of the game.\n\n<br>\n\n## Configuration\n\nLithium makes use of an semi-unusual configuration system which allows you to enable or completely disable patches the mod applies. This system allows fine-grained control over what code in Minecraft is modified by Lithium, and as such, can be used to completely eliminate bugs or mod incompatibilities introduced by the mod.\n\n<br>\n\nFor more information, please read [the wiki entry](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/lithium-fabric/wiki/Configuration-File) on modifying your configuration file.\n\n<br>\n\nPlease note: An empty configuration file is *perfectly normal* and just means you want to use the default options, which are already set up out of the box for the best performance the mod can offer.\n\n<br>\n\n## Reporting Issues\n\nPlease use the issue tracker linked at the top of the page to report bugs, crashes, and other issues.\n\n",

          "body": "This mod reduces the memory usage of Minecraft in a few different ways. A high-level technical description of the changes is available [here](https://github.com/malte0811/FerriteCore/blob/main/summary.md).\n\nThe amount of memory saved will depend on the pack. In version 2.5.9 of [All Of Fabric 3](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/all-of-fabric-3) it reduces the RAM usage (heap size) from 1,792 MB to 984 MB. For comparison the same setup with Hydrogen instead of FerriteCore uses 1,335 MB.  \nThese values were measured after generating a world with a fixed seed and waiting for two minutes.\nThe project picture is a cropped version of [this](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Magnetic-core_memory,_at_angle.jpg) picture.\n\n### FAQ\n\n#### Should I install this on the server or just on the client?\n\nSome optimizations are client-side only, but there are some rather high-impact optimizations that are relevant on the server too. So you should install it on both sides.\n\n#### Is this compatible with [other mod]?\n\nMost likely yes. The only exception is Hydrogen, which is compatible with all recent FerriteCore versions *on Minecraft versions where Hydrogen is officially released*. This means that 1.18+ builds are not compatible with Hydrogen, since it has been officially archived and won't receive any releases on these versions.",

href=\"https://curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/immediatelyfast\"><img src=\"https://cf.way2muchnoise.eu/full_686911_downloads.svg\"></a>\n\n  <p>ImmediatelyFast is an open source Minecraft mod which improves the immediate mode rendering performance of the client.\n  <br />It is designed to be lightweight and compatible with other mods.</p>\n</div>\n\n## Optimizations\nImmediatelyFast generally optimizes all immediate mode rendering by using a custom buffer implementation which batches\ndraw calls and uploads data to the GPU in a more efficient way.  \nThe following parts of the immediate mode rendering code are optimized:\n\n- Entities\n- Block entities\n- Particles\n- Text rendering\n- GUI/HUD\n- Immediate mode rendering of other mods\n\nIt also features targeted optimizations where vanilla rendering code is being changed in order to run faster.  \nThe following parts of the rendering code are optimized with a more efficient implementation:\n\n- Map rendering\n- HUD rendering\n- Text rendering\n\n## Performance\nHere are some performance comparisons of areas the mod optimizes particularly well:\n\nIf other mods are listed in the table this means that this mod also optimizes that part of the game.\n\nTest Hardware: Ryzen 5 1600, 32GB DDR4, GTX 1060\n\nFPS Numbers were taken from external tools (in this case MSI Afterburner) and averaged over a couple of seconds.  \nIf you decide to test this yourself keep in mind that ImmediatelyFast can only improve FPS in a scenario where your CPU\nis the bottleneck (Most likely the case if your GPU isn't ancient or you use very heavy shaders).\nSlower CPUs will benefit more from this mod than really fast CPUs.\n\n### Entity Rendering\nGenerally FPS should be around **2x higher** on busy servers. [Tested using IF 1.1.7 on 1.19.3]\n\n_Tested on a spigot server with 1000 cows in a 3x3 box on screen._\n\n| Other mods      | Without ImmediatelyFast | With ImmediatelyFast | Improvement |\n|-----------------|-------------------------|----------------------|-------------|\n| None            | 16 FPS                  | 60 FPS               | 3.75x       |\n| Sodium          | 21 FPS                  | 82 FPS               | 3.90x       |\n| Iris and Sodium | 60 FPS                  | 76 FPS               | 1.27x       |\n\n### Map Rendering\nGenerally FPS should be around **5x higher** when there are many maps on screen. [Tested using IF 1.1.1 on 1.19.3]\n\n_Tested on a fabric server with the [Image2Map](https://modrinth.com/mod/image2map) mod and around 930 maps on screen._\n\n| Other mods      | Without ImmediatelyFast | With ImmediatelyFast | Improvement |\n|-----------------|-------------------------|----------------------|-------------|\n| None            | 50 FPS                  | 310 FPS              | 6.20x       |\n| Sodium          | 47 FPS                  | 320 FPS              | 6.81x       |\n\n### HUD Rendering\nGenerally FPS should be around **40% higher** in almost all scenarios. [Tested using IF 1.1.7 on 1.19.3]\n\n_Tested on a spigot server with different HUD elements on screen (Scoreboard, Potion effect overlay, Bossbars, Filled Chat, Extra hearts, Full Hotbar)._\n\n| Other mods          | Without ImmediatelyFast | With ImmediatelyFast | Improvement |\n|---------------------|-------------------------|----------------------|-------------|\n| None                | 250 FPS                 | 380 FPS              | 1.52x       |\n| Sodium              | 335 FPS                 | 630 FPS              | 1.88x       |\n| Exordium and Sodium | 740 FPS                 | 840 FPS              | 1.14x       |\n\n### Text Rendering\nGenerally FPS should be around **2x higher** when there are many signs or holograms around you. [Tested using IF 1.1.7 on 1.19.3]\n\n_Tested on a spigot server with 200 signs (Filled with text) on screen._\n\n| Other mods      | Without ImmediatelyFast | With ImmediatelyFast | Improvement |\n|-----------------|-------------------------|----------------------|-------------|\n| None            | 70 FPS                  | 125 FPS              | 1.79x       |\n| Sodium          | 110 FPS                 | 300 FPS              | 2.73x       |\n\n### Block-Entity Rendering\nGenerally FPS should be around **20% higher** when there are many block entities around you.

Most Forge 1.16-1.19.2 modpacks will launch **roughly twice as fast** with ModernFix installed.\nIf some non-default options are enabled, it can even allow large modpacks like All The Mods 8 to run with **3GB or less of allocated memory**.\n\nModernFix is free, open-source software. All of the code is available on [the GitHub repository](https://github.com/embeddedt/ModernFix).\n\n## ⚙️ Technical summary\n\nWhat exactly does ModernFix do for your game? There are a lot of tweaks being made - too many to summarize here. However, here is a\nbrief summary of the general types of improvements being made:\n\n* Backports of bugfixes from newer versions of Minecraft and/or Forge, e.g. fixing\n[worlds breaking when you remove a dimension mod in 1.18](https://github.com/MinecraftForge/MinecraftForge/issues/8800).\n* Patches to mods that are no longer supported on a given Minecraft version, to improve the gameplay experience instead of requiring\nplayers to update.\n* Many optimizations & improvements to the game's launch process to significantly improve speed and reduce random concurrency crashes.\n* Additional debug tools to help modders and players determine the cause of some rare game crashes/freezes, instead of relying on a painful\nmod bisection process.\n* It's not enabled by default due to compatibility issues, but ModernFix includes functionality to [completely redesign the game's model loading system](https://github.com/embeddedt/ModernFix/wiki/Dynamic-Resources-FAQ), replacing it with a new,\ndynamic version that loads models on the fly. Model loading is one of the major performance regressions to modded Minecraft that\nhas been present since 1.8, and this new system alleviates nearly all of the downsides, bringing memory usage and loading times\nmore in line with how they were in 1.7.10.\n* Need to play the game with very little RAM allocated (e.g. 512MB or less)? [Now you can do that.](https://github.com/embeddedt/ModernFix/wiki/Ultra%E2%80%90Low-Memory-Footprint)\n\nIf you are technically savvy and looking for more details on each patch, I recommend reading the [Summary of Patches](https://github.com/embeddedt/ModernFix/wiki/Summary-of-Patches) wiki page.\n\n## 🐛 Where to go when something doesn't work\n\nPlease either report an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/embeddedt/ModernFix), or join the [Discord](https://discord.gg/rN9Y7caguP) and ask in the `#modernfix-discussion` channel.\nBe sure to mention the Minecraft version, modloader, and ModernFix version you are using, as well as what other mods you have installed.\n\n## 🎁 How can I support this project?\n\nThere are two main ways you can help support the development of ModernFix:\n\n* Spread the word! Test ModernFix in modpacks and encourage them to include it.\n* If you feel generous, I do accept donations via [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/embeddedt). Donating is not required (as ModernFix is free),\nbut every little bit helps. I work on ModernFix in my spare time, so any compensation I receive helps to sustain development.\n\n## ❓ What other mods should I use?\n\nThere are many performance mods available for Minecraft and I can't list them all here, but here are some essential mods, in my opinion:\n\n- On any version before 1.19.4 you should always have LazyDFU installed, as it eliminates the incredible lag caused by the DFU system.\n- On any version before 1.20 you should generally use Starlight unless it has a compatibility issue with your mods (which is quite rare).\nIt offers vastly improved lighting performance and can also fix FPS stutters when moving between chunks.\n- Always have FerriteCore installed, as Mojang's implementation of blockstates/models is laughably inefficient, and quickly\nconsumes RAM as soon as more content is added beyond what vanilla offers.\n- Install a mod like Shutup Experimental settings (before 1.19) or Yeetus Experimentus (1.19+). These mods will suppress the\npop-up screen about experimental game features, which otherwise causes the game to reload its resources twice.\n\nOn a related note: I do **not** recommend use of OptiFine in any modded scenario. It is closed-source, patches the game in a way that easily breaks\nForge and other mods, and significantly slows down game launching, often on the order of minutes. Please try Sodium (on Fabric) or Embeddium (on Forge) instead!\nUsing OptiFine with ModernFix is not officially supported, and may cause issues.\n\n## 🖥️ Need a server?

[Chip in a bit of money](https://github.com/sponsors/astei) so I can continue developing it.\n\n## What's Krypton?\n\nKrypton (from Ancient Greek _kryptos_, \"the hidden one\") is a Fabric mod that attempts to optimize the Minecraft networking stack. It derives from work\ndone in the [Velocity](https://velocitypowered.com/) and [Tuinity](https://github.com/Spottedleaf/Tuinity)\nprojects.\n\nKrypton contains several optimizations, including:\n\n* **Highly optimized Netty handlers** derived from the [Velocity](https://velocitypowered.com) proxy, which I am the developer of. These handlers have seen real-world usage and extensive profiling, and strategically deploy native code where it makes the most sense.\n* **Flush consolidation** to lower server CPU usage (and reducing the impact from hardware security vulnerabilities which exploit speculative execution) and lower server tick times.\n* **Micro-optimizations** to reduce memory usage and improve packet serialization speeds.\n\n[Please join my Discord](https://discord.gg/RUGArxEQ8J) to discuss the mod or get support.\n\n## Compatibility\n\nKrypton should work anywhere where a Minecraft can run &mdash; naturally, however, it is tuned for Linux.\n\nI try to ensure that Krypton will work with the Fabric API, Lithium, and Sodium.

It is _not_ required to be installed on both sides.\nIf you have Starlight on the server, clients can use Vanilla/Phosphor/Starlight to connect. Likewise, if you have Starlight on \nthe client, you can connect to Vanilla/Phosphor/Starlight servers.\n\nStarlight cannot be installed _with_ Phosphor, they are completely incompatible. \nBrowsing through [Starlight's Issue Tracker](https://github.com/PaperMC/Starlight/issues \"Starlight's Issue Tracker\") will show\nfurther mod incompatibilities. Starlight is a rather destructive light engine rewrite, so it should be \nexpected to break mods more often.\n\nPurpose\n------------------\nStarlight was developed for higher scale dedicated servers, as they suffered performance problems due to how ungodly slow the\nlight engine was. The only solution was to create an extremely invasive mod which rewrote the entire light engine.\nI ported the mod to fabric so that I can update it during snapshots, and decided that publishing it for \nall users, especially client users, would be beneficial. However, it does have the downside of being an invasive mod:\nBeing invasive didn't affect higher scale servers because they run on Bukkit.\n\nFurther reading on the technical details of how Starlight achieves its performance \ncan be read here: [TECHNICAL_DETAILS.md](https://github.com/PaperMC/Starlight/blob/fabric/TECHNICAL_DETAILS.md \"TECHNICAL_DETAILS.md\")\n\nPerformance for 1.20:\n------------------\nHere are a few graphs showing performance in 2 areas on: Block editing at high y-levels, and normal block light updates:\n\n~~Light engine time chunk generation Graph~~ has been removed as a benchmark as it is invalid for 1.20. Starlight and Vanilla are close enough on 1.20 that\nthis test is also useless.\n![Block update at height graph](https://i.imgur.com/ZQx7Ek0.png \"Block update at height graph\")\n![Simple glowstone block update](https://i.imgur.com/MrA2PQk.png \"Simple glowstone block update\")\n\nPerformance for 1.19.4 and below:\n------------------\nHere are a few graphs showing performance in 3 critical areas: Chunk generation, Block editing at high y-levels, and normal block light updates:\n\n![Light engine time chunk generation Graph](https://i.imgur.com/5aI8Eaf.png \"Light engine time chunk generation Graph\")\n![Block update at height graph](https://i.imgur.com/kKtbe9y.png \"Block update at height graph\")\n![Simple glowstone block update](https://i.imgur.com/yCNK602.png \"Simple glowstone block update\")",

          "body": "LazyDFU is an optimization mod for Minecraft that defers unnecessary initialization work so that it is only performed if required. Specifically, it makes the initialization of DataFixerUpper \"lazy\" - that is, it will not immediately create the rules required to migrate data from older versions of Minecraft to newer versions until it actually needs to do so.\n\n**This mod is for Fabric/Quilt**\n\n## Compatibility\n\nLazyDFU 0.1.2 is compatible with Minecraft 1.14 through 1.18.2, and works on the client and server side.\n\nLazyDFU 0.1.3 is compatible with Minecraft 1.19 and above, however Mojang now implements the functionality LazyDFU provides on the server side. The client still initializes all DFU rules by default, so LazyDFU hooks into the native client functionality that enables DFU rule baking and turns it into a no-op.\n\n**As of Minecraft 1.19.4 and above, however, Mojang has significantly optimized DFU initialization enough that this mod is no longer necessary in many configurations. It will continue to be supported for older versions of Minecraft.**\n\n## Sponsor me!\n\nDid this mod make Minecraft playable for you? [Chip in a bit of money](https://github.com/sponsors/astei) so I can continue developing it.\n\n## Why does it work?\n\nDataFixerUpper (often abbreviated to DFU) is the Minecraft component responsible for handling world upgrades from older versions of Minecraft to newer versions. DFU is initialized very early in the Minecraft startup process - in fact, it's initialized before the game window even appears. It is laughably overengineered and very slow, but it's what Mojang gives us to work with.\n\nAs part of the DFU initialization process, it caches rules required to convert from older versions to MInecraft through every version in between, up to the version of the game being launched. This process takes place in the background, but it is _extremely_ slow, as it is both CPU and memory intensive. With Minecraft 1.16.5, I have measured this process take 9 seconds on a Ryzen 9 3900X desktop (a high-end desktop CPU released in 2019) and 57 seconds on a laptop with an i5-8250U (a mid-range laptop chip from 2017).\n\nAll LazyDFU does is stop this process - it lets DFU initialize, but it will force it to not cache all these rules. As a result, the DFU rules are only compiled when a world needs to be converted. This means it is possible you may see lag spikes if LazyDFU forces the game to compile migration rules, but once complete there is no performance penalty.\n\n## Prove it to me\n\nI [recorded a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXDqJ598kKA) that shows you how effective LazyDFU is.\n\n## Comparing it to other mods\n\nIn comparison to other mods, LazyDFU has the primary advantage of being _simple_, _safe_, and having _low impact_ on the game.\n\n* LazyDFU is a very simple mod. The entire mod is about a dozen lines of code, about as uncomplicated as a mod can get, while still delivering huge benefits. (This means it's also an ideal mod to use to experiment with a new Mixin platform!)\n* LazyDFU is highly compatible and safe. LazyDFU is extremely unlikely to conflict with other mods. This mod is based on a similar patch in [Paper](https://papermc.io) that had been in use for over a year with no reported issues with migrating to newer versions of Minecraft. (Paper has since changed to replacing Mojang's data fixers with a highly optimized implementation of its own.)",

          "body": "## Enhanced Block Entities\n\nEBE is a **100% client side** Minecraft mod for the **[Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/use/)** mod loader which aims to increase the performance of block entity rendering, as well as offer customizability via resource packs. <br/><br/>\n**How does it work?** EBE Makes some block entities use baked block models rather than laggy entity models. <br/><br/>\n**Is it just an optimization mod?** EBE isn't *just* an optimization mod, some side effects of its optimizations are many visual improvements. <br/>\nThese may include:\n- Smooth lighting on block entities\n- Being able to remodel block entities with block models\n- Toggling features like christmas chests\n- Being able to see block entities from as far away as possible\n<br/><br/>\n\n**What about animations?** The best part about EBE is that you still get to keep animations, while gaining the performance boost of baked models! Most animated block entity models will only render when absolutely necessary. <br/><br/>\n\n### [Indium](https://modrinth.com/mod/indium) is required to use EBE with [Sodium](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium). <br/><br/> \n**Requires [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api)**\n<br/><br/>\n\n\n## FAQ and Help\n\n**Q: I need help with the mod/need to report a bug!** <br/>\n**A:** If you're having trouble setting up the mod or using it alongside other mods, I'd recommend you join our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/7Aw3y4RtY9) and ask for help there. *If the issue is a BUG* please report it on our issue tracker (\"Issues\" tab at the top of the page)<br/><br/>\n\n**Q: My chests have glitched animations!** <br/>\n**A:** You're likely using Sodium, which doesn't support certain Fabric Rendering features by default. If you need to use Sodium with EBE, you should install [Indium](https://modrinth.com/mod/indium). <br/><br/>\n\n**Q: My chests are invisible!** <br/>\n**A:** You may be using a resource pack that conflicts with EBE. Open the Block Entity Settings menu (through EBE's Mod Menu entry or through vanilla Video Settings) and enable \"Force Resource Pack Compatibility\". <br/><br/>\n\n**Q: How is this different from [FastChest](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fastchest)?** <br/>\n**A:** FastChest does not preserve chest animations, and only optimizes chests (in a similar way to EBE). EBE also optimizes other block entities:\n- Ender Chests\n- Signs\n- Bells\n- Beds\n- Shulker Boxes\n- Decorated Pots\n<br/><br/>\n\n## FPS Boost\nRendering 1700 chests:\n### Vanilla\n![Before](https://github.com/FoundationGames/EnhancedBlockEntities/raw/116_indev/img/before.png)\n### With EBE\n![After](https://github.com/FoundationGames/EnhancedBlockEntities/raw/116_indev/img/after.png) <br/>\nA 155% frame rate increase!\n\n## Resource Packs\nHere's an example of how you can customize chests with resource packs using EBE. <br/><br/>\n![Custom Chest GIF](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55095883/112942134-f67fe780-912f-11eb-8b11-cf316544c22b.gif)",

          "body": "# Concurrent Chunk Management Engine (Fabric)\n\nA Fabric mod designed to improve the chunk performance of Minecraft.\n\n## So what is C2ME?\nC^2M-Engine, or C2ME for short, is a Fabric mod designed to improve the performance of chunk generation, I/O, and loading. This is done by taking advantage of multiple CPU cores in parallel. For the best performance it is recommended to use C2ME with [Lithium](https://modrinth.com/mod/lithium) and [Starlight](https://modrinth.com/mod/starlight).\n\n## What does C2ME stand for?\nConcurrent chunk management engine, it's about making the game better threaded and more scalable in regard to world gen and chunk io performance.\n\n## So what is C2ME not?\n**C2ME is currently in alpha stage and pretty experimental.**  \nAlthough it is usable in most cases and tested during build time, it doesn't mean that it is fully stable for a production server.  \nSo backup your worlds and practice good game modding skills.\n\n## Support\nOur issue tracker: [link](https://github.com/RelativityMC/C2ME-fabric/issues)  \nOur discord server: [link](https://discord.gg/Kdy8NM5HW4)\n\n## Development builds\n**Note: Development builds may modify the config files in a way unreadable by previous versions. You may encounter crashes or config reset when rolling back to previous versions. Please always backup your config.**\n\nYou can find development builds here: https://ci.codemc.io/job/RelativityMC/job/C2ME-fabric  \nNote that these builds may contain more bugfixes and performance improvements but are less tested.  \nIf you have encountered any problems in release builds, give development builds a try before reporting. \n\n## FAQ\n- Q: Does this benefit client as well or only server?  \n  A: https://github.com/RelativityMC/C2ME-fabric/issues/116\n\n\n## More information\nCheck out the `README.md` here: https://github.com/RelativityMC/C2ME-fabric\n",

The existing main config libraries don't achieve what I want from them:\n\n- **[Cloth Config API](https://modrinth.com/mod/cloth-config)**: **It's stale.** The developer of cloth has clarified that they are likely not going to add any more features. They don't want to touch it. ([citation](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43245524/206530322-3ae46008-5356-468e-9a73-63b859364d4e.png))\n- **[SpruceUI](https://github.com/LambdAurora/SpruceUI)**: **It isn't designed for configuration.** In this essence the design feels cluttered. Further details available in [this issue](https://github.com/isXander/Zoomify/issues/85).\n- **[MidnightLib](https://modrinth.com/mod/midnightlib)**: **It has cosmetics among other utilities.** It may not be large but some players (including me) wouldn't want cosmetics out of nowhere.\n- **[OwoLib](https://modrinth.com/mod/owo-lib)**: **It's content focused.** It does a lot of other things as well as config, adding to the size.\n\nAs you can see, there's sadly a drawback with all of them and this is where YetAnotherConfigLib comes in.\n\n## How is YACL better?\n\nYACL has the favour of hindsight. Whilst developing this fresh library, I can make sure that it does everything right:\n\n- **Easy API.** YACL takes inspiration from [Sodium's](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium) internal configuration library.\n- **It's styled to fit in Minecraft.** YACL's GUI is designed to fit right in.\n\n## Usage\n\n[The wiki](https://github.com/isXander/YetAnotherConfigLib/wiki/Usage) contains a full documentation on how to use YACL.\n\n## Screenshots\n\n<center><div align=\"center\">\n\n![java_A3zdbksGkC](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43245524/206924832-293b0780-2a8c-4b09-8765-155318d09ed9.png)\n\n</div></center>\n\n## License\n\nThis mod is under the [GNU Lesser General Public License, v3.0](LICENSE).\n",

It is a maintained version of the [original Smooth Boot mod](https://github.com/UltimateBoomer/mc-smoothboot), allowing you to still change CPU thread priorities in-game.\n\n### Why was this made if it's no longer needed?\n\nWhile the main function of Smooth Boot was fixed in 1.19.4, the mod still allows you to adjust thread priorities, which can still be quite beneficial on some systems as shown in [UltimateBoomer/mc-smoothboot #54](https://github.com/UltimateBoomer/mc-smoothboot/issues/54).\n\n### Is this faster than the original mod?\n\nNot in any way - this is simply a maintained version of the final version of Smooth Boot. There may or may not be extra features or improvements added as requested or while I have the time.\n\n<details>\n<summary>Email with permission from the original author</summary>\n\nHello Devin,\n\nI certainly have no problems if you want to maintain a fork of Smooth Boot for future versions of Minecraft. I understand that Smooth Boot can still be useful in version 1.20 and later, though personally I'm not interested in maintaining the mod right now. I also suggest a different name to be used, though you don't have to if you don't want to. Smooth Boot's original purpose of making Minecraft launch faster is no longer necessary, so a different name would convey the purpose of the mod more accurately.\n\nThanks,\n\nUltimateBoomer\n\n</details>",

However, unlike other similar mods, this one does not just hide the recipe book button. NERB completely removes its functionality.\n\n \n\nIf you have a fully unlocked recipe book in a large modpack and run the command /data get entity @s, you will see how horrible the amount of data it gives (most of them are recipe names). However, after installing this mod, these recipe names will disappear, which greatly improves the performance of CraftTweaker / KubeJS (e.g. using event.player.data in event scripts) or other mods to read player data, and speeds up data sync between the server and the client & makes player join world faster.\n\nThis mod should be installed both on client- and server-side!",

          "body": "Disable unwanted items from existing using JSON configuration.\n\n- Supports Fabric/Quilt 1.19.2 - 1.20.X, 1.21\n\n- Supports Forge 1.19.2 - 1.20.1\n\n- Supports NeoForge 1.20.1\n\n## Features\n\n\n- **Inventory Removal.** The Item won't be held or dropped anymore, it will be removed if exists.\n- **Creative Tab Removal.** The Item won't appear in the respective creative tab it was.\n- **Trade Removal.** All trades involving the item will be removed from villagers.\n- **Recipe Removal.** Removes all recipes (Crafting, furnaces, and custom mod recipes).\n- **NBT Removal.** Remove specific potions, enchanted books, or anything!\n- **REI Integration.** Banned items won't appear in REI.\n- **EMI Integration.** Banned items won't appear in EMI.\n- **JEI Integration.** Banned items won't appear in JEI.\n- **Regex Support.** Save yourself time by using regular expressions.\n- **Optimized.** Item Obliterator will never cause lag! And can be used as an optimization tool if certain items cause lag.\n\n### Specific Configs\n- **Disable Items Completely.** You can blacklist items to be removed with all features above.\n- **Disable Only Specific NBT in Items.** You can blackliist items that have specific NBT tags. Works with regex too!\n- **Disable Only Item Attacks.** You can blacklist items to only disable its attacks.\n- **Disable Only Item Interaction.** You can blacklist items to only disable interactions (Right-Click).\n- **Disable Only Recipes.** You can blacklist recipes only if they contain the item.\n \n\n## FAQ\n\n\n- **Can I use this in my modpack?**\n  \nOf course! It was designed for modpack creators to remove undesired items that may unbalance the game or create issues.\n\n \n\n- **Client or server?**\n\nThe mod is needed on both client and server. As it has some client features, but also server ones.\n\nCan work server-side only, but JEI/REI/EMI and creative tab removals won't work.\n\n \n\n- **What if I mispell an item ID in the config file?**\n\nNothing will happen. Adding invalid ID's won't cause issues, but obviously the item won't be blacklisted as it technically doesn't exist. Same thing would happen if the mod isn't present, but it will be if it's added later and the ID is valid.\n\n\n\n## Example Configuration:\n\n\nConfiguration is as simple as adding JSON entries for each item you want to obliterate.\n\nItems can be from vanilla or any mod, you just have to add the id with the proper namespace, like minecraft:golden_apple\n\nIt's located inside the config folder, with the file \"item_obliterator.json5\" (>=2.0.0) or \"item_obliterator.json\" (< 2.0.0)\n\n![Configuration](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1050578253489917992/1197387350930620456/image.png)",

So no classic 4 element schools are implemented, besides fire.)\n\nThe library offers an API to query spell damage of an entity (based on its attributes, status effects, enchantments), and provides critical strike chance and multiplier. Critical striking is completely rng based, powered by secondary attributes.\n\n## 📦 Content\n\n### Entity Attributes:\n\n- Spell Power, one for each specific magic school (for example: `spell_power:fire`)\n- Spell critical chance (id: `spell_power:critical_chance`)\n- Spell critical damage (id: `spell_power:critical_damage`)\n- Spell haste (id: `spell_power:haste`), can be used to quicken spell casting or cooldowns\n\n### Status Effects:\n\n- One specifically for each introduced attribute, with a matching id (for example: `spell_power:fire`, `spell_power:critical_chance`)\n\n(All status effects come with fancy icons 😍)\n\n### Enchantments:\n\n- Universal Spell Power (named: \"Spell Power\"), increasing all spell damage\n- School limited Spell Power (for example: \"Sunfire\", increasing arcane and fire damage) \n- Secondary attribute enchantments (for example: \"Spell Critical Chance\")\n- \"Magic Protection\" (totally symmetric to Projectile Protection, but for magic)\n\n(All enchantments are fully configurable, and come with descriptions)\n\n# 🔧 Configuration\n\n**Server side** configuration can be found in the `config` directory, after running the game with the mod installed.\n",

Slot groups are collections of slots for a certain body part or more vague area. By default there are 6 slot groups (head, chest, legs, feet, offhand, hand) that can have slots added to them, but more groups can be added if desired. Trinkets' UI is intuitive to use, accessible, and attempts to do away with clutter. Its system means that you'll never have a slot that's not used for anything, as mods request the slots they want.\n\nFor basic tutorials and comprehensive documentation, visit this project's [wiki](https://github.com/emilyploszaj/trinkets/wiki/Home).\n",

Register any field with only a simple annotation, regardless of mod loader!</li>\n<li>Custom reimplementation of Jigsaw Manager with improved performance and custom pool element types with various new properties. Check out the <a href=\"https://github.com/yungnickyoung/YUNGs-Better-Dungeons\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Better Dungeons code</a> to see it in action.</li>\n<li>New criteria trigger for safely locating any structure. If the given structure doesn't exist, the trigger simply fails rather than instantly passing (unlike vanilla).</li>\n<li>Interfaces for JSON serialization &amp; deserialization&nbsp;with built-in type adapters.</li>\n<li>Simple, lightweight math utilities for vectors and column positions</li>\n<li><em>BlockStateRandomizer</em> and <em>ItemRandomizer</em>, data abstractions that make adding block and item randomization to your structures incredibly simple. I use these for all of my mods!</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you're curious, you can check the code for my mods (especially the newer ones) to see how things work. Feel free to ask me any questions on Discord!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/a49IMQJ.png\" /><br />\n<a title=\"Get 25% off your server with code YUNGNICKYOUNG at Bisect Hosting!\" href=\"https://bisecthosting.com/yung\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/nQRs7ZP.png\" alt=\"Use code YUNGNICKYOUNG with Bisect Hosting for 25% off!\" width=\"1344\" height=\"400\" /></a></p>",

It includes support for a <em>bunch</em> of modded dimensions.\n</p>\n\n## Adding Custom Sounds\n<p>To use custom sounds, all you have to do is create a small resource pack with the namespace <code>travelerstitles</code>. In the <code>sounds</code> folder, you can add any or all of three custom sounds, named <code>dimension.ogg</code>, <code>biome.ogg</code>, and <code>waystone.ogg</code>. Each of these sounds will play when entering a new dimension, biome, and waystone, respectively. If no custom sound is provided for any of these, then no sound will play for the respective type of title.\n</p>\n\n## Additional Customization\n<p>Using lang files in resource packs, you can add your own dimension &amp; biome titles!<br />\nDimensions use a lang entry format like the following:</p>\n<p><code>\"travelerstitles.namespace.dimensionname\": \"Title\"</code></p>\n<p>Biomes use the same lang entries as always, guaranteeing built-in support for any mod's biomes, like so:</p>\n\n<p><code>\"biome.namespace.biomename\": \"Title\"</code></p>\n\n<p>However, should you want to change a vanilla or modded biome's title without potentially affecting other areas of the game that might use the biome's translation, you can use a special format specifically for this mod via the following:\n</p>\n\n<p><code>\"travelerstitles.biome.namespace.biomename\": \"Title\"</code></p>\n\n<p>Both dimensions and biomes also support an optional <code>color</code> lang entry which will override the configured default text color for that specific dimension or biome. The following is a complete example that adds a red title for the Nether and a green title for the Plains biome:<br />\n</p>\n\n<pre><code>\"travelerstitles.minecraft.the_nether\": \"The Nether\",\n\"travelerstitles.minecraft.the_nether.color\": \"ff0000\",\n\"travelerstitles.biome.minecraft.plains\": \"Plains\",\n\"biome.minecraft.plains.color\": \"00ff00\"</code></pre>\n\n<p>Note that for a biome's <code>color</code> entry, it is also acceptable to have the key start with <code>travelerstitles</code>, and any biome color entry with <code>travelerstitles</code> prepended to it will take priority over other entries.<br />\nFor example, the following would resullt in blue (<code>0000ff</code>) text for the <code>desert</code> biome, since entries prepended with <code>travelerstitles</code> take priority:\n</p>\n\n<pre><code>\"biome.minecraft.desert.color\": \"ff0000\",\n\"travelerstitles.biome.desert.color\": \"0000ff\"</code></pre>\n\n<p>Also note that colors are RGB hex-formatted strings.</span></p>\n\n<p><a title=\"Lang entries\" href=\"https://github.com/YUNG-GANG/Travelers-Titles/tree/1.19/Common/src/main/resources/assets/travelerstitles/lang\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">See here</a> for the lang entries that come included with the mod in 1.19.2. Lang entries for other versions may be available on a different branch.</p>\n\n## Debug commands\n<p>The following commands work in single player worlds if you have sufficient permissions. They can be used to preview what titles will look like when you encounter them in the game.</p>\n\n<p><code>/biometitle &lt;biome&gt;</code><br />\n<code>/dimensiontitle &lt;dimension&gt;</code></p>",

It provides many of the same features as [Cloth Config](https://modrinth.com/mod/cloth-config) while many new conveniences, like server-client config synchronization, added on top\n\n - A fully automatic [registration system](https://docs.wispforest.io/owo/registration/) that is designed to be as generic as possible. It is simple and non-verbose to use for basic registries, yet the underlying API tree is flexible and can also be used for many custom registration solutions\n\n - [Item Group extensions](https://docs.wispforest.io/owo/item-groups/) which allow for sub-tabs inside your mod's group as well as a host of other features like custom buttons, textures and item variant handling\n\n - A fully-featured [networking layer](https://docs.wispforest.io/owo/networking/) with fully automatic serialization, handshaking to ensure client compatibility and a built-in solution for triggering parametrized particle events in a side-agnostic manner\n\n - Client-sided particle helpers that allow for easily composing multi-particle effects\n\n - Rich text translations, allowing you to use Minecraft's text component format in your language files to provide styled text without any code\n\n***\n\nowo is documented in two main ways:\n\n - There is rich, detailed JavaDoc throughout the entire codebase\n - There is a wiki with in-depth explanations and tutorials for most of owo's features over at https://docs.wispforest.io/owo/features/",

For developers, add the following to your `build.gradle`. \n\n```gradle\nrepositories {\n    maven {\n        name = \"Modrinth\"\n        url = \"https://api.modrinth.com/maven\"\n        content {\n            includeGroup \"maven.modrinth\"\n        }\n    }\n}\n\ndependencies {\n    modImplementation \"maven.modrinth:data-attributes-directors-cut:<version>\"\n}\n```\n\n<details><summary>Alternatively, if you are using cursemaven:</summary>\n\n```gradle\nrepositories {\n    maven {\n        name = \"Cursemaven\"\n        url = \"https://cursemaven.com\"\n    }\n}\n\ndependencies {\n    modImplementation \"curse.maven:data-attributes-directors-cut-955929:<version-file-id>\"\n}\n```\n\n</details>\n\nNote that Data Attributes: Directors Cut depends on [Fabric API](https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric), so you will need to consider this as well. \n\nIt also does not support Attributefix, as they have the same capabilities.\n\n### • F.A.Q\n- Will you make a Forge version?\n  - We shall not as the original mod author did not, but the license allows you to do so yourself.\n- I think that I've found a bug/crash, where can I report it?\n  - Please make an entry to the [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/PlayerEXDirectorsCut/data-attributes/issues).\n\nPlease also note that the mod AttributeFix is incompatible with Data Attributes - they have the same capabilities!\n\n### • Wiki\n\nFor more detailed documentation, please see the [wiki](https://github.com/CleverNucleus/Data-Attributes/wiki).\n\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/V38aMzY.png\" alt=\"Sponsor Banner\"/></p>\n<p><b>Use code &quot;BAREMINIMUM&quot; to get 15% off your first month!</b></p>",

The mod provides RPG-themed attributes to the game and a configurable leveling system.\n\n### Content 📦\n\nWith higher-level, highly configurable attribute modification provided by **[Data Attributes: Directors Cut](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/data-attributes-directors-cut)**, PlayerEX integrates skill and refundable points to spend through the non-intrusive, extendable, and modern screen, which can be activated by a hotkey (default is `-`).\n\n### Extras 🎬\n\n- **[EXHud](https://modrinth.com/mod/exhud-directors-cut)**, which provides an optional, opinionated and highly-configurable UI complimentary for PlayerEX, and has compatibility with other mods, such as [**Thermoo**](https://modrinth.com/mod/thermoo), and [**AppleSkin**](https://modrinth.com/mod/appleskin).\n\n- **[RelicEX](https://modrinth.com/mod/relicex-directors-cut)**, which adds relics, tomes, different ways to obtain level, skill, and refund points.\n\n- **[WizardEX](https://modrinth.com/mod/wizardex-directors-cut)**, which provides a layer between this mod and **[Wizards](https://modrinth.com/mod/wizards)** and other mods that use **[Spell Power Attributes](https://modrinth.com/mod/spell-power)**.\n\n### Wiki 📑\n\nTo learn more about the mod, you can go **[here!](https://bareminimumstudios.github.io/Bare-Minimum-Docs/)**\n\n### Developers 💻\n\nAh, my favorite people. You will get some more information on how to mod PlayerEX once the release is stable. For now, know that you will be getting:\n\n- A way to implement attribute modification (and target any attribute you want and apply functions to them) into a registry.\n- Override **any** registered attribute.\n- Apply **any** attribute to **any** `LivingEntity` (primarily for the player).\n- Attach to a screen using `owo-lib`.\n- And much more...\n\n### For Forge Users 🪨\n\nHowdy, I know you have all been **dying** for a forge release. This will come in due time.

Here is your chance!\n------------------\n[![Modloader](https://img.shields.io/badge/Loader-Fabric%20|%20Forge-ecebe6?labelColor=263768&style=for-the-badge)](https://fabricmc.net)\n[![Discord](https://img.shields.io/discord/973561601519149057.svg?label=&logo=discord&logoColor=ffffff&color=7389D8&labelColor=6A7EC2&style=for-the-badge)](https://discord.gg/KN9b3pjFTM)\n\n\n&zwnj;\n\n# 🧶️ Features\n\n&zwnj;\n\n## Adds Combat Roll ability\nPress `R` to roll (by default). You can roll into any direction you are heading (forwards, backwards, sideways, etc...)\n\nThe combat roll ability has 4 seconds cooldown by default.  (Server side configurable)\n\nCooldown of your combat roll ability can be seen on the main UI (aka HUD). (Client side configurable)\n\nExhaust (aka hunger) is added to the player upon rolling (Server side configurable)\n\nRoll ability can only be used when player is: not using item, not jumping, not swimming.\n\n**New!** Now with invulnerability frames! (Disabled by default, can be turned on at `config/combatroll/server.json5`)\n\n&zwnj;\n\n## Attributes\n\nThese new entity attributes determine the properties of the combat roll ability.\n\n`combatroll:distance` determines how far the player rolls (the default distance is 3 blocks, server configurable). For example:\n\n`/give @s leather_boots{AttributeModifiers:[{AttributeName:\"combatroll:distance\", Name:\"testing\", Amount:3.0, Operation:0,Slot:\"feet\",UUID:[I; 66453, 79497593, -201178, -16957605]}]} 1`\n\n`combatroll:recharge` determines how quickly the cooldown of the roll ability recovers. For example: \n\n`/give @s leather_leggings{AttributeModifiers:[{AttributeName:\"combatroll:recharge\", Name:\"testing\", Amount:0.5, Operation:1,Slot:\"legs\",UUID:[I; 66453, 79497593, -201177, -16957605]}]} 1`\n\n`combatroll:count` determines how many times a player can roll before having to wait for recharging (by default a player has 1 roll). For example: \n\n`/give @s leather_helmet{AttributeModifiers:[{AttributeName:\"combatroll:count\", Name:\"testing\", Amount:2, Operation:0,Slot:\"head\",UUID:[I; 66453, 79497594, -201177, -16957605]}]} 1`\n\n&zwnj;\n\n## Enchantments\nImprove various aspects of your combat roll ability with these enchantments.\n\n### Mulit-Roll\nCan be enchanted on helmets - Grants extra rolls (+1 roll / level)\n\n### Acrobat\nCan be enchanted on chests and legs - Increases the recharge speed of the roll cooldown (by +10% / level)\n\n### Longfooted\nCan be enchanted on boots - Increases the distance of your rolls (by 1 block / level).\n\n&zwnj;\n\n# 🔧 Configuration\n\n&zwnj;\n\n### Fabric\n\nClient side settings can be accessed via the [Mod Menu](https://github.com/TerraformersMC/ModMenu).\n\n### Forge\n\nClient side settings can be accessed in Main Menu &gt; Mods &gt; Combat Roll &gt; Config.\n\n### Server\n\n**Server side** configuration can be found in the `config` directory, after running the game with the mod installed.",

Enjoy playing in third person view. :)\n### Natural look and feel\nAttacks have an upswing phase before the hit is actually performed, like in real life.\n### Weapon combos\nSome weapons have a sequence of different attacks.\n### Dual wielding\nDual wield any one handed weapons! Use the attack hotkey to alternately attack with main-hand and off-hand.\n### Reworked Sweeping Edge\nWeapon swing hitting multiple enemies deal reduced damage. To deal full weapon damage against all targets, you need to have Sweeping Edge enchantment.\n### Hold to attack\nHold the attack hotkey to spam attacks on cooldown (configurable).\n### Swing thru grass\nAttack instead of mining zero hardness blocks (configurable).\n### Support any item from any mod (with data files)\nAutomatic compatibility with most mods (weapons without attribute file, will be automatically assigned a matching weapon preset, based on item id).\n\nSuper easy to add dedicated compatibility, support via Discord for partnering modders.\n\n&zwnj;\n\n&zwnj;\n\n# 🔨 Add compatibility to any weapon\n&zwnj;\n\nAdd uniquely created or out of the box behaviour to any weapon from any mod, by just creating **JSON** data files.\n\nCheck out our integration guide [here](https://github.com/ZsoltMolnarrr/BetterCombat#-integrate-your-mod \"integration guide\").\n\n&zwnj;\n\n# 🔧 Configuration\n&zwnj;\n\n**Client side** settings can be accessed via the [Mod Menu](https://github.com/TerraformersMC/ModMenu).\n\n**Server side** config can be found at:\n\n- General properties: `config/bettercombat/server.conf`\n\n- Fallback compatibility: `config/bettercombat/fallback_config.conf`\n\nAutomatically created with default values, upon loading any game world for the first time. \n\n&zwnj;\n\n# ⛓ Compatibility\n\n&zwnj;\n\nWith an open source and modular mindset, this project is aiming for maximal compatibility. However, mods trying to change the same mechanics will never be compatible (such as dual wielding mods).\n\n&zwnj;\n\n## 🤝 Partnerships\n\n&zwnj;\n\nWe partnered up with the following mods, to fully utilise the JSON API of Better Combat:\n\n- [MC Dungeons Weapons](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/mcdw)\n\n- [MCDoom](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/mcdoom)\n\n- [MedievalWeapons](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/medievalweapons)\n\n- [Mythic Metals](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/mythicmetals)\n\n- [Simply Swords](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/simply-swords)\n\n- [Spectrum](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/spectrum)",

          "description": "A mod that completely overhauls the vanilla enchanting system",
          "body": "# Enchancement\nEnchancement is a mod that aims to completely overhaul vanilla Minecraft's enchanting system, along with some other adjacent mechanics.\n\nEnchancement currently adds 30 unique and fun enchantments to the game:\n\n```\nHelmet Enchantments:\n* Assimilation: Automatically consumes food when you're hungry, prioritizing off hand. Food and drinks are consumed faster.\n* Perception: Increases visibility in the dark and causes mobs to be seen through walls.\n* Veil: Decreases monster detection range and hides your name behind walls.\n\nChestplate Enchantments:\n* Amphibious: Increases underwater mining and movement speed. Decreases air consumption underwater and time spent on fire. Immediately extinguishes you and allows usage of Riptide for some time after leaving water.\n* Strafe: Double tapping Left Control (configurable) launches you in your movement direction.\n* Wardenspine: Harms and blinds attackers and greatly decreases damage taken from behind.\n\nLeggings Enchantments:\n* Adrenaline: Increases movement speed and reduces damage taken proportional to missing health.\n* Dash: Pressing Left Shift (configurable) in the air launches you in your look direction.\n* Slide: Holding Left Control (configurable) while grounded causes you to slide constantly. Pressing Left Control (configurable) in the air causes you to slam towards the ground, knocking back mobs and negating fall damage.\n\nBoots Enchantments:\n* Buoy: Causes you to walk on fluids, descending via sneaking. Holding jump while submerged rapidly propels you upwards. Prevents floating. Grants a speed boost for some time after leaving water.\n* Bouncy: Negates fall damage. Launches you upwards upon landing while not sneaking. Sneaking while grounded will charge a super jump.\n* Gale: Allows you to jump more times in the air.\n\nSword Enchantments:\n* Berserk: Increases damage dealt proportional to missing health.\n* Frostbite: Freezes attacked mobs. When killed, turns them into ice statues that can be moved or shattered, launching ice shards that freeze other mobs.\n\nBow Enchantments:\n* Chaos: Gives arrows a random negative potion effect, or positive if sneaking.\n* Delay: Arrows will pause after shooting, building up damage over time. Can be launched prematurely by punching, and additionally redirected by sneaking.\n* Phasing: Causes arrows to have no gravity and phase through blocks, upon which they regain gravity. Arrows home in on nearby entities.\n\nCrossbow Enchantments:\n* Brimstone: Fires a piercing laser that ignores armor and increases damage with charge and distance. Costs health to fire.\n* Scatter: Allows Amethyst Shards to be loaded which explode into a burst of projectiles.\n* Torch: Allows rapid loading of Torches that ignite shot mobs. Torches that land on a block will be placed if fired while sneaking. The Crossbow can only load Torches.\n\nTrident Enchantments:\n* Leech: Regenerates health when dealing damage. Thrown Tridents will temporarily stick to mobs and deal damage.\n* Warp: Teleports you to the location of the Trident if it didn't hit a mob.\n\nPickaxe Enchantments:\n* Extracting: Extracts materials from connected ores, leaving the stone behind. Disabled while sneaking.\n* Molten: Smelts mined blocks. Disabled while sneaking.\n\nAxe Enchantments:\n* Beheading: Slain mobs and players have a chance to drop their head.\n* Lumberjack: Connected logs will also be destroyed. Disabled while sneaking.\n\nShovel Enchantments:\n* Bury: Using on a mob will bury it if the ground below is soft enough.\n* Scooping: Deals extra damage and increases mob loot drops.\n\nFishing Rod Enchantments:\n* Disarm: Steals or disables a latched entity's held item.\n* Grapple: Allows the Fishing Bobber to latch onto blocks. Launches you towards that block upon release. Reels in entities with more strength.\n```\n\nOf the core changes, this mod will:\n* Overhaul the Enchanting Table with a new UI that removes the RNG involved in enchanting; you may simply choose the enchantments you wish to have.\n* Remove leveling from enchantments, meaning that the max level for all enchantments will be 1. Enchantments that are brought down to this level will act as their original max level counterpart, an example being Riptide I will function the same as Riptide III. Enchantments on gear made from materials easier to obtain will be weaker.\n* Force items to only allow one enchantment.\n* Remove durability from most aspects of the game. Items in the `enchancement:retains_durability` tag will continue to have durability.\n* Remove most vanilla enchantments from the game. Enchancement tries to make choosing your enchantments more fun and engaging by replacing many of the boring stat change enchantments with enchantments that grant the player unique abilities.\n\nEnchancement also adds some quality of life changes:\n* Add Coyote Bite, which allows attacking an entity for 3 ticks after it leaves your crosshair.\n* Adds descriptions to the tooltip of enchanted items and colors enchantment names green.\n* Allows keybinds (Vanilla and Enchancement by default, configurable) to be bound to the same key without conflicting.\n* Fishing Bobbers are accurately thrown instead of having a weird offset.\n* Arrows shot from Bows will drop on the ground near the shot entity, allowing recollection.\n* Crossbows can pull projectiles from your inventory instead of just from your off-hand.\n* Drowned will use the data of their held Trident when throwing it.\n* Enchanted Chestplates increase your air mobility.\n* Enchanted tools have built in Efficiency.\n* Enchanted Tridents have built in Loyalty.\n* Bows are drawn faster and don't decrease your movement speed as much.\n* Enchanted Books are free to merge with items in an Anvil.\n* Luck of the Sea acts as if the item also has Lure.\n* Ender Pearls no longer deal damage upon landing.\n* Projectiles ignore invulnerability frames (with damage falloff) and negate velocity.\n* Mobs can spawn with any random enchantment.\n* Iron armor has been made stronger and Golden armor has been made slightly weaker.\n* Channeling works during any weather, not just when thundering. Channeling also creates lightning that does not create fire or destroy items, and ignites entities for 3 seconds on melee attack.\n* Fire Aspect is usable as Flint and Steel if you are sneaking, and ignites for less time.\n* Golden Apples can only be eaten while hungry.\n* Makes a select few potions a bit weaker to account for the removal of some enchantments.\n* Tridents will automatically return to you if thrown in the void.\n* Weapon enchantments such as Fire Aspect or Frostbite will not function unless the player's attack cooldown is >= 70%.\n\n**Q: Can I disable any of these changes?**\n\nA: Everything in the mod is configurable down to disabling the entire mod if there are features that you wish to disable. All of the config options are self explanatory except for enchantmentLimit (0 means no limit, greater than 0 means items cannot have more than that number of enchantments).\n\n**Q: Why did you remove most of the vanilla enchantments?**\n\nA: I do not like how much of the vanilla enchanting meta relies exclusively on Protection, Sharpness, Power, and other such stat increasing enchantments. I also dislike Fortune because it creates a mindset of not mining ores until you have Fortune, which I find incredibly dumb.\n\n**Q: I want to keep every enchantment anyway. How do I do this?**\n\nA: In the configuration file, remove all entries from disallowedEnchantments.\n\n**Q: I changed the config and now my gear is either too weak or too strong, can you fix this?**\n\nA: Enchancement is heavily designed around using the default configuration file, any balance concerns created by modifying the config will not be addressed as it is outside of the scope of the mod's vision.\n\n## External Links\nSupport me on Ko-fi!

This is required for mod configuration, as it allows for using the exact same system as on the Forge mod loader.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/E6BUT4h.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center; line-height: 36px;\"><a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/members/fuzs_/projects\"><img src=\"https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=&amp;message=Fuzs_&amp;color=ecebe6&amp;labelColor=2F4858&amp;style=for-the-badge&amp;logo=curseforge&amp;logoColor=white\" width=\"97\" height=\"28\" /></a>&emsp;<a href=\"https://github.com/Fuzss\"><img src=\"https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=&amp;message=Fuzss&amp;color=ecebe6&amp;labelColor=2F4858&amp;style=for-the-badge&amp;logo=github&amp;logoColor=white\" width=\"97\" height=\"28\" /></a>&emsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2l26SuCmCNSCPefpfbCX7Q\"><img src=\"https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=&amp;message=Fuzs&amp;color=ecebe6&amp;labelColor=2F4858&amp;style=for-the-badge&amp;logo=youtube&amp;logoColor=white\" width=\"89\" height=\"28\" /></a>&emsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/Fusseel\"><img src=\"https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=&amp;message=@Fusseel&amp;color=ecebe6&amp;labelColor=2F4858&amp;style=for-the-badge&amp;logo=twitter&amp;logoColor=white\" width=\"124\" height=\"28\" /></a>&emsp;<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Fusseel\"><img src=\"https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=&amp;message=u/Fusseel&amp;color=ecebe6&amp;labelColor=2F4858&amp;style=for-the-badge&amp;logo=reddit&amp;logoColor=white\" alt=\"Reddit\" width=\"130\" height=\"28\" /></a>&emsp;<img src=\"https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=&amp;message=Fuzs%200212&amp;color=ecebe6&amp;labelColor=2F4858&amp;style=for-the-badge&amp;logo=discord&amp;logoColor=white\" width=\"127\" height=\"28\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/E6BUT4h.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>",

Click the banner or [here](http://bit.ly/4bczSJY) and use code 'tr7zw' to get a 25% discount for your Minecraft Server and to support future development of the mod.\n\nThis mod brings a lot of missing third-person animations from the first-person or modifies them to be better representative to how they should look like or look like in the first-person. This mod was created as an expansion for the [First-Person Mod](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/first-person-model), but works completely on its own and is fully vanilla/3rd party server compatible(since it's all just visual).\n\n### All features can be enabled/disabled individually in an ingame config screen! (Accessible via the ModList/ModMenu)\n\nAdded/fixed animations:\n\n- Eating/Drinking\n\n![](https://tr7zw.dev/nea/eating.png)\n![](https://tr7zw.dev/nea/drinking.png)\n\n- Maps(Yes you can see the map content if your client has been sent the map by holding it once/seeing it in an item frame)\n\n![](https://tr7zw.dev/nea/maps1.PNG)\n![](https://tr7zw.dev/nea/maps2.PNG)\n\n- Shield placement(you block where you look, not where the body is rotated to. So this will rotate the body with the head while blocking)\n\n![](https://tr7zw.dev/nea/shield.png)\n\n- Don't show items during two-handed animations(Hide the offhand item while using a bow/crossbow)\n\n![](https://tr7zw.dev/nea/twoHands.PNG)\n\n- Boat rowing(No longer sitting there and staring at the self-moving Paddles)\n\n![](https://tr7zw.dev/nea/boat.png)\n\n- Horses(at least act like you're holding the reins)\n\n![](https://tr7zw.dev/nea/horse.png)\n\n- Looking at a compass/clock(this one is actually more eye candy for the First-person Mod to make the compass better usable, but won't hurt outside of that, can be modified in the config file to extend to more items)\n\n![](https://tr7zw.dev/nea/compass.PNG)\n\n- Ladder/climbing animation\n\n![](https://tr7zw.dev/nea/ladder.gif)\n\n- Crawling animation, replacing the swimming one while out of water\n\n![](https://tr7zw.dev/nea/crawling.gif)\n\n- Smooth arm movement and transitions\n\n![](https://tr7zw.dev/nea/smootharms.gif)\n",

          "body": "‼️‼️ **SODIUM USERS** ‼️‼️: You must install **[Indium](https://modrinth.com/mod/indium)** if you use **[Sodium](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium)**!\n\n# Continuity\n\nContinuity is a Fabric mod that allows resource packs that use the OptiFine connected textures format, OptiFine emissive textures format (only for blocks and item models), or OptiFine custom block layers format to work without OptiFine.\n\nContinuity depends on Fabric API and is client-side only. It includes two built-in resource packs. The Default Connected Textures pack provides connected textures for glass, sandstone, and bookshelves, similar to the built-in connected textures provided by OptiFine. The Glass Pane Culling Fix pack culls faces between vertically stacked glass panes to make them look seamless with connected textures.\n\nFormally, Continuity implements the Continuity connected textures specification, Continuity emissive textures specification, and Continuity custom block layers specification. All of these are extensions of the corresponding OptiFine specification and were created to provide more features to resource pack authors. The documentation for the Continuity specifications can be found at the [Continuity wiki](https://github.com/PepperCode1/Continuity/wiki).\n\nAn official Forge version of Continuity is not planned at this time due to major technical differences between the Fabric and Forge APIs. An official Forge version of Continuity may be considered if these differences are minimized, possibly via the use of libraries.\n\n### Links\n\n[CurseForge Page](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/continuity)\n",

If you want more OptiFine features on Fabric, you can either check [this list](https://lambdaurora.dev/optifine_alternatives), made by LambdaAurora, **or** you can use the [Fabulously Optimized modpack](https://modrinth.com/modpack/fabulously-optimized), which includes **all** the OptiFine parity mods!\n\n### Featuring:\n\n- [🎲](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Texture_Features/blob/master/.github/README-assets/RANDOM_GUIDE.md) Custom & random entity textures with the OptiFine format, including even more properties!\n- [💡](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Texture_Features/blob/master/.github/README-assets/EMISSIVE_GUIDE.md) Emissive/glowing entity textures with the OptiFine format\n- [😑️](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Texture_Features/blob/master/.github/README.md#-blinking-textures) Blinking mobs\n- [🎨](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Texture_Features/blob/master/.github/README-assets/SKIN_GUIDE.md) Player skin features\n\n## Compatibility\n\n- OptiFine's random/custom or emissive entity resource packs - <img src=\"https://emojipedia-us.s3.amazonaws.com/source/skype/289/check-mark-button_2705.png\" alt=\"✅\" width=\"15\"> **Fully compatable**\n- [Entity Model Features (EMF)](https://modrinth.com/mod/entity-model-features) - <img src=\"https://emojipedia-us.s3.amazonaws.com/source/skype/289/check-mark-button_2705.png\" alt=\"✅\" width=\"15\"> **Fully compatible**\n- [dorianpb's CEM mod](https://modrinth.com/mod/cem) - <img src=\"https://emojipedia-us.s3.amazonaws.com/source/skype/289/check-mark-button_2705.png\" alt=\"✅\" width=\"15\"> **Fully compatible**\n- [Sodium](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium) - <img src=\"https://emojipedia-us.s3.amazonaws.com/source/skype/289/check-mark-button_2705.png\" alt=\"✅\" width=\"15\">  **Fully compatible**\n- [Iris Shaders](https://modrinth.com/mod/iris) - <img src=\"https://emojipedia-us.s3.amazonaws.com/source/skype/289/check-mark-button_2705.png\" alt=\"✅\" width=\"15\"> **Fully compatible**<br />(Support varies depending on the shader)\n- Mod added entities - <img src=\"https://emojipedia-us.s3.amazonaws.com/source/skype/289/check-mark-button_2705.png\" alt=\"✅\" width=\"15\"> **Compatible**<br />(Only if the mod creator used the vanilla rendering code to render their mobs)\n\n## Settings & configuration\n\n- Settings can be changed in-game using [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu), the settings button in the resource pack screen, or  by editing the config file, located under `config/entity_texture_features.json`\n- A few of these options can also be changed via the [Puzzle mod](https://modrinth.com/mod/puzzle)\n\n<img src=\"https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Texture_Features/raw/master/.github/README-assets/options.png\" alt=\"Options\" width=\"450\">\n\n## Mod support\n\n- This mod should be compatible with any mod added entities as long as they extend `LivingEntityRenderer` class for rendering and utilise it correctly\n- Any mod displaying an entity in a custom GUI can force the default texture by having the `entity.getblockstate` set to either `null` or of type `VOID_AIR`, the same can be achieved by settings the display mob's UUID to `UUID.nameUUIDFromBytes((\"GENERIC\").getBytes())`. \n\n## FAQ\n\n My entities are invisible/broken!\n\n> Custom Entity Models is not a feature provided by ETF. If your entities are invisible or look corrupted you'll need to instal my other mod [Entity Model Features EMF](https://modrinth.com/mod/entity-model-features) as well (this includes resource packs such as Fresh Animations). Keep in mind that the CEM mod is still in alpha development and may still occur issues.\n\n Blocks and items are not emissive!\n\n> ETF does not support emissive block and item texture, for that you'll need to install [Continuity](https://modrinth.com/mod/continuity).\n\n My game is lagging, help!\n\n> If you are experiencing lag please check your most recent log file to see if any errors are being logged, sometimes an incorrectly written properties file or missing textures may lag the system.\n\n It doesn't work!\n\n> Check if any issues are not actually a problem in the properties file, a few packs seem to be pointing to a texture that doesn't exist.\n So far all mob entities support random & emissive textures, but there may still be some quirks. If you find bugs you can either [report them in GitHub](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Texture_Features/issues/new?assignees=Traben-0&labels=bug&template=bug_report.md&title=%5BBUG%5D+%22short+issue+description%22) or get support in the Discord server (linked on the top of the page).\n\n> Emissives are broken with Complimentary shaders, what do I do?\n\n>Complementary shaders has its own in-built emissive textures that usually work fine but will conflict with some resource packs. You can either disable Complimentary's emissives or ETF's emissives to fix this.\n\n My question isn't here!\n\n> Feel free to check ETF's [Discord](https://discord.gg/invite/rURmwrzUcz) to ask your questions or check the FAQ there :)\n\n## Change log\n\n [Changelog](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Texture_Features/blob/master/common/CHANGELOG.md).\n\n## License\n\nThis mod is under the [GNU Lesser General Public License, v3.0](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Texture_Features/blob/master/LICENSE).\n\n## Hosting Partner deal\n\n[![image](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/BVzZfTc1/images/bfb592538f8206a6a2d72d19c90714bea91b0e07.png)](https://billing.kinetichosting.net/aff.php?aff=641)",

(primarily used to support the random model feature, the config screen, and allow textures set in models to vary like in OptiFine)\n\n#### Highly recommended\n- [Entity Culling](https://modrinth.com/mod/entityculling): This mod does wonders for reducing entity rendering lag, doing even more than Sodium's included entity culling. This is very beneficial when using animation heavy packs like Fresh Animations.\n\n\n## Fresh Animations?\nYes.\n\nit works :)\n\n<img width=\"450\" src=\"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/4I1XuqiY/images/2f32dbeadc25e46ef6c56f0e47e5eb5d305c8ea2.png\">\n\n<br>\n\n[Download Fresh Animations](https://www.planetminecraft.com/texture-pack/fresh-animations-v1-0/)\n\n\n## Features & OptiFine differences & Known Bugs\n\nUp-to-date feature details page : [Features & Optifine differences](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Model_Features/blob/master/FEATURES.md)\n\n\n## FAQ\n\n> **Q:** Do all OptiFine CEM resource packs work?\n\n**A:** Most packs work fine, but I'm sure there are some exceptions, report any found issues [here](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Model_Features/issues), or on my [discord](https://discord.com/invite/rURmwrzUcz).\n\n> **Q:** What's different between EMF and dorianpb's [CEM](https://modrinth.com/mod/cem)?\n\n**A:** EMF is in a complete state and has a nearly 1 to 1 parity with OptiFine CEM, EMF also does a few extra things like player animations and armor model support, with more ideas on the way :)\n\nEMF also does things differently under the hood with little to no hardcoding of support for vanilla models. Allowing full CEM support for various modded entities.\n\n> **Q:** Backports?\n\n**A:** Backports to 1.18 & 1.19 are planned.\nBackports to version 1.17 and below are not planned at this time.\n\n## License\n\nEMF is licensed under the [GNU Lesser Public License](LICENSE), version 3.0\n\n## Hosting Partner deal\n\n[![image](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/BVzZfTc1/images/bfb592538f8206a6a2d72d19c90714bea91b0e07.png)](https://billing.kinetichosting.net/aff.php?aff=641)",

Dynamic lights are lights created by an entity holding an\nitem which makes light as a block, or created by an entity on fire, etc.\n\n[Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/embed/r8r1TNG45tM?wmode=transparent)\n\nSearching other mods to replace OptiFine? [Check out this list!](https://optifine.alternatives.lambdaurora.dev/)\n\n## ✅ Features:\n\n- Dynamic lights.\n- Settings to select how smooth the dynamic lighting is.\n- Works with some modded items.\n- Any entity holding an item which emits light will emit light!\n- Magma cubes emit light.\n- Spectral arrows emit light.\n- Burning entities emit light.\n- Blazes emit light.\n- Some items like torches, soul torches, etc. will not light up in water.\n- Quick and simple API for developers.\n- And more!\n\n## Screenshots\n\n### Items emit light\n\nDropped items which already emit light as a block, will also dynamically emit light!\n\n![Torch](https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/301/21/2020-07-04_22.png)\n\n### Held items emit light\n\nLight is emitted when entities hold light emitting items.\n\n![Fox holding lantern](https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/301/22/2020-07-04_22.png)\n\n### Fire! Fire! Fire!\n\nAny entity on fire will emit light!\n\n![Skeleton on fire!](https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/301/23/2020-07-04_22.png)\n\n### Spectral arrows\n\nSpectral arrows will emit a very weak light!\n\n![Spectral arrows](https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/301/25/2020-07-04_22.png)\n\n### Different luminance!\n\nLight emitted from items depend on the light emitted from their respective blocks!\n\n![light levels](https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/301/26/2020-07-04_22.png)\n\n### Configuration GUI\n\nAs of v2.1.0.\n\n![Configuration GUI](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LambdAurora/LambDynamicLights/1.19/images/settings_main.png)\n![Entities Configuration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LambdAurora/LambDynamicLights/1.19/images/settings_entities.png)\n\n## 📖 Usage\n\nUsing this mod is very simple!\n\nInstall it in your mods folder along with [Fabric API] and [ModMenu], (and [Sodium] if wanted for better performances).\n\nYou will notice nothing at first but if you go into the video options or into the settings screen of the mod via [ModMenu], you will notice an option called Dynamic Lights which is by default off, choose the wanted configuration and enjoy!\nYou can also configure the mod by editing the file in `config/lambdynlights.toml`.\n\nNeed help? Come check out [my Discord server][LambdAurora Discord].\n\n\n\n## 📖 How does it work internally?\n\nCheck [this documentation](https://github.com/LambdAurora/LambDynamicLights/blob/1.17/HOW_DOES_IT_WORK.md).\n\n## 📖 Is there an API? How to use it as a developer?\n\nCheck [this documentation](https://github.com/LambdAurora/LambDynamicLights/blob/1.17/API.md).\n\n# 📖 Compatibility\n\n- [Sodium] is recommended for better performances.\n- [Canvas] is compatible but still WIP: expect huge lag spike with it until a proper lighting API is done in Canvas.\n- **OptiFabric is obviously incompatible.**\n\n\n**<p style=\"color: red\">Please, when you write the name of this mod, don't add spaces.</p>**\n\n[fabric]: https://fabricmc.net\n[Mod loader: Fabric]: https://img.shields.io/badge/modloader-Fabric-1976d2?style=flat-square&logo=data:image/png;base64,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\n[Fabric API]: https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api \"Fabric API CurseForge page\"\n[ModMenu]: https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu\n[Sodium]: https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/sodium \"Sodium CurseForge page\"\n[Canvas]: https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/canvas-renderer \"Canvas CurseForge page\"\n[LambdAurora Discord]: https://discord.gg/abEbzzv\n",

All previous features have been restored and some new ones added, with new development promised for the future on the opensource github profile!\n\n---\n\nExpect to see a more rich and immersive Minecraft world, one where Presence Footsteps adds new and more dynamic sounds for every block the player walks on. Every block has its own material assigned to it, and can make their own, customized sounds to better match what they're made of.\n\n---\n\n- Wooden chests are creaky and old,\n- stone is dusty and rough.\n- Piston heads sound like wood, whilst their bodies are stone,\n- even cake sounds like you might destroy if you step in the frosting!\n- Tall grass and bristles make a dry, rustling sound as you step through them,\n- Magma sounds like it's literally cooking your souls!\n\n---\n\nNot only that, but the latest version includes step sounds for certain non-block entities:\n\n---\n\nShulkers make the same creaky box noises as Shulker boxes, boats sound like wood, and armour stands creak and produce a stone stepping sound as you walk on their stone slab base.\n\n ---\n\n## Sound Packs\n\nPresence Footsteps is **fully customisable** with resource packs. The mod by default includes a pack with its own sounds\nand material mappings for the vanilla blocks, however if you don't like those sounds or want to use your own, this pack can be turned off\nor used together with packs from the community.\n\nNote that you need **at least one** sounds pack enabled for the mod to function.\n\n![image](https://github.com/Sollace/Presence-Footsteps/assets/6429283/9c50aa59-0f59-4324-aab7-cb360acac2ad)\n\n## Mod Support\n\nPresence Footsteps will attempt to figure out the sounds of modded blocks by looking at the vanilla material/sound types they use.\nIf your mod is using very unique sounds though, you can add mappings to your mod to directly control what sounds presence footsteps uses for your block by\nfollowing the [guide on our wiki](https://github.com/Sollace/Presence-Footsteps/wiki/Information-for-Resourcepack-Creators)\n",

What does it do?\nMCPatcher had a feature called Custom Item Textures(or CIT for short) which was later adopted by Optifine.\n\nCustom Item Textures allowed resourcepacks to replace the appearance of items when they met certain conditions.\n\nCIT Resewn does exactly that but as a standalone Fabric mod which does not require MCPatcher nor Optifine!\n\nOn top of that, CIT Resewn aims to build upon the concept of CITs by expanding the available types and conditions.\n\n### How is it different than MCPatcher/Optifine's CIT?\nCIT Resewn is intended to be fully backwards compatible with the old Optifine/MCPatcher packs. Though there are some key differences.\n\nFirst, the numeric id system was removed since the Flattening. Packs utilizing the so called \"magic numbers\" instead of the new text ids will not work.\n\nSecond, Optifine and old minecraft versions have a bug which allows resourcepacks to put files in malformatted(or \"broken\") paths.<br>\nThese are paths that contain \"Non (lower cased) a-z, 0-9, dots, underscores and dashes\" characters within either the file name or its parent directories. In the case that you must use such a broken pack, there is a compromise set up which is still highly experimental and not recommended. You can go to CIT Resewn's settings and allow broken paths. (I'm serious, this is not recommended at all)\n\nLastly, to ensure compatibility with foreign packs, CITs will be loaded from .properties files under:\n`assets/minecraft/citresewn/cit`\n`assets/minecraft/optifine/cit`\n`assets/minecraft/mcpatcher/cit`\n\n### Does CIT Resewn support Optifine/Sodium?\nWhile CIT Resewn is designed to work without any performance mod needed, I will try my best to ensure it is compatible with Sodium.\n\nWith all that said, there will not be support for Optifine at all.\n\nThere were also discussions around Sodium alternatives such as Canvas.<br>\nMy official statement on compatibility with these mods is \"if it works it works\" unless I say otherwise.\n\n### What about Forge?\nForge is being kinda doodoo recently and Fabric's Mixins is what allows the mod to inject cits into vanilla so smoothly.\n\nDo not ask for a forge port or I'll break your elbows.\n\n### 1.16/other versions?\nSee [Issues#120](https://github.com/SHsuperCM/CITResewn/issues/120)\n\n<strike>If a version says it's for 1.x, it means it is aimed to work on all of 1.x's minor versions but specifically recommended for its listed minor version.</strike><br>\nWell not anymore! Thanks a lot mojank   ._.\n\n\n[<center><img src=\"https://citresewn.shcm.io/img/project_description/docs.png\" alt=\"Go to the docs for more info!\" width=\"268\" height=\"53\"></center>](https://citresewn.shcm.io/)",

Currently contains over **90** events hooks, networking\nabstraction, loader calls abstraction, game registry abstraction and an easy to use @ExpectPlatform annotation (Only\nworks on static methods).\n\n### Do I really need this API?\n\nArchitectury API is only one part of the architectury ecosystem, **Architectury Plugin** is the gradle plugin enabling\nall this multiplatform actions.\n\nArchitectury API is optional for projects built on architectury, you may create your architectury project with just\nArchitectury Plugin.\n\n### Advantages of Architectury\n\n- Open sourced\n- Less boilerplate for your multiplatform mod\n\n### Getting started with making multiplatform mods\n\nArchitectury Loom: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-loom (a fork of Fabric Loom adding multiplatform development capabilities)\n\nGradle Plugin: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-plugin (includes Architectury Injectables, for the `@ExpectPlatform` annotation)\n\nExample Mod: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-example-mod (a discontinued example mod using Architectury, if possible, use the templates instead)\n\nMod Templates: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-templates (a set of templates to get started using the Architectury toolchain)\n\n### Example: Usage of @ExpectPlatform\n![Exmaple of the @ExpectPlatform annotation, part of Architectury Injectables](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/78c68766affb70fbd88f9806e0e95f78765ec339448d7102065f2942be2b3215/68747470733a2f2f6d656469612e646973636f72646170702e6e65742f6174746163686d656e74732f3538363138363230323738313138383130382f3737363432383831343330393738353632302f756e6b6e6f776e2e706e673f77696474683d31313931266865696768743d343339)\n\n### Credits\n\nIn certain older versions, this library used to bundle typetools; you can find its license [here](https://github.com/jhalterman/typetools/blob/master/LICENSE.txt \"\")",

Install a compatible mod loader:\n    - 1.16.5 and later: install Minecraft Forge or Fabric.\n    - 1.14.4 and later: install Minecraft Forge.\n    - 1.12.2 and earlier: install either Minecraft Forge or LiteLoader (or both).\n2. Put the Mouse Tweaks jar-file into the mods folder in your .minecraft directory.\n\nMouse Tweaks is purely client-side. There is no server-side component.\n\n### Extras\n\n[**Mouse Tweaks API**](https://github.com/YaLTeR/MouseTweaks/tree/master/src/main/java/yalter/mousetweaks/api)\n\nConfiguration file: `.minecraft/config/MouseTweaks.cfg`\n\n## Tweaks\n\n### RMB Tweak\n\nVery similar to the standard RMB dragging mechanic, with one difference: if you drag over a slot multiple times, an item will be put there multiple times. Replaces the standard mechanic if enabled.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `RMBTweak=1`\n\nHold your right mouse button:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Uo7xF.png)\n\nDrag your mouse around the crafting grid:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/NCRED.png)\n\nYou can drag your mouse on top of existing items:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/6MQv6.png)\n\n### LMB Tweak (with item)\n\nLets you quickly pick up or move items of the same type.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `LMBTweakWithItem=1`\n\nHold your left mouse button to pick up an item:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ziuGG.png?1)\n\nDrag your mouse across the inventory. Items of the same type will be picked up:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/JDjsE.png?2)\n\nHold shift and drag. Items of the same type will get \"shift-clicked\":\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/YrvmT.png?2)\n\n### LMB Tweak (without item)\n\nQuickly move items into another inventory.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `LMBTweakWithoutItem=1`\n\nHold shift, then hold your left mouse button:\n\n*(Mouse cursor is not visible for some reason)*\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/f9Ejp.png?1)\n\nDrag your mouse across the inventory. Items will get \"shift-clicked\":\n\n*(Mouse cursor is not visible for some reason)*\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/qBu6k.png?2)\n\n### Wheel Tweak\n\nScroll to quickly move items between inventories. When you scroll down on an item stack, its items will be moved one by one. When you scroll up, items will be moved into it from another inventory.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `WheelTweak=1`\n\n**Configuration setting:** `WheelSearchOrder=1`\n\nWhen you scroll up, the mod will search for items from last to first (when this is set to 1) or from first to last (when this is set to 0).\n\n**Configuration setting:** `WheelScrollDirection=0`\n\nSet this to 1 to invert the default scroll actions. So, when set to 1, scrolling down will pull the items and scrolling up will push the items.\n\nSet this to 2 to enable the inventory position aware scrolling. Scrolling up will push the items into the other inventory if it's above the selected slot, or pull items from the other inventory if it's below the selected slot. Vice versa for scrolling down.\n\n### Obsolete / Removed Settings\n\nThese settings existed in older Mouse Tweaks versions but were removed since.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `OnTickMethodOrder=Forge, LiteLoader`\n\nMouse Tweaks can use multiple APIs for an OnTick method that it requires. You can use this setting to control the API it prefers. This shouldn't really matter at all. If a method isn't supported (for example, you don't have the API installed) the mod will proceed to check the next ones.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `ScrollHandling=0`\n\nToggles between \"smooth scrolling, minor issues\" (0) and \"non-smooth scrolling, no issues\" (1). When set to smooth scrolling, minor issues may be experienced such as scrolling \"through\" JEI or other mods. When set to non-smooth scrolling, those issues will not happen, but the scrolling will be a little non-smooth. Non-smooth scrolling works only with the Forge OnTick method.\n\nThis option is set to smooth scrolling by default because the aforementioned issues require rather specific conditions to trigger and aren't very impactful, while scrolling items is something you do all the time and want the experience to be as good as possible.\n\n## Compatibility\n\nMouse Tweaks is compatible with everything based on `GuiContainer` (as long as the behavior isn't changed too much).\n\nIf your GUI isn't based on `GuiContainer`, or if you want to improve compatibility (making Mouse Tweaks ignore some slot, for example), take a look at the [API documentation](https://github.com/YaLTeR/MouseTweaks/blob/2dc5bb108c2663f9a07b3a181483733a0274b41a/src/api/java/yalter/mousetweaks/api/IMTModGuiContainer3.java).\n\n## Modpacks\n\nFeel free to include Mouse Tweaks in modpacks.\n",

          "body": "Features of this library are:\n\n- Dynamic resource pack utilities\nA set of utilities that allow creating dynamic runtime resource packs and datapacks. Also easily allows respriting and retexturing existing textures, specifically useful to add new wood based blocks.\n\n \n\n- Dynamic block set registration\nAllows mods to specify a block set (which can be for example a wood type). The mod then will scan all registered blocks and fill the block set up only to then allow mods to register blocks that depend on it.\n\nThis can't be easily done using traditional methods since the wood set itself depends on the registered blocks so registration must happen at a very specific time. This utility makes that task possible and easy to do. Note that it is still a form of dynamic registration which might have some drawbacks.\n\nIn a nutshell you have dynamic wood type support for your blocks. The wood set type already comes built-in.\n\n \n- Custom map markers: \nA complete system that allows to easily implement and add map decoration and map markers as well as control every aspect of them like rendering. Also allows storing simple data inside maps data offering a couple of hooks to use it too like on item tooltip.\nThis system also offers a simple Data Driven implementation meaning you can easily register new markers with datapacks!\n \n\n- Dynamic Villager AI\nA helper system to easily and dynamically add tasks and modify villager schedules in a compatible way without overriding the whole existing AI. Also allows to properly add memory types\n\n \n\n- Custom first and third person animations:\nAllows modders to implement a simple interface in their items to allow it to have custom third and first person animations (like crossbows). \nIncludes simple and easy to use interfaces that can let you control first person and third person animations as well as a callback for rendering the item itself (similar to spyglass) directly in your item class\n\n \n- Grindstone achievement triggers:\nThe mod adds a custom trigger that gets called when an item is passed through a grindstone that you can call in your mods advancements jsons\n\n\n- Soft fluid system:\nAn entirely Data Driven custom virtual fluid system that goes on top of forge one and is designed to fit better in vanilla minecraft and having as main feature the ability to have multiple fluid containers items like bottles, bowls and buckets, as well as providing support for stews and drinks that can be consumed directly from a fluid tank. As opposed to the forge fluid system it has a base unit of 1 minecraft bottle (250 forge mb). The system also automatically generates all the needed fluids for already registered forge fluids and allows the user to override them or add to them easily. Fluids are virtual so they can only exist in modded container specifically for them\n \n\n-Dispenser utilities:\nSome code that allows to easily register dispenser behaviors without overriding already existing ones. Also comes with builtin spawn egg and block placement behaviors\n\n ",

Its features are tailored to be functional, aesthetically viable, and complementary to preexisting content and provide many new ways to enhance your Vanilla+ experience.\n> The mod requires Moonlight Library<br>\n> While supported, Fabric version might be missing some minor features as the mod is mainly for Forge<br>\n> You are free to include this mod in your modpack\n\nTranslated in the following languages!\nDeutsch | Polski | Fran&ccedil;ais | Русский | Italiano | English | Če&scaron;tina | 한국어 | Українська | Portugu&ecirc;s | Српски | Espa&ntilde;ol | Қазақ | Bahasa Melayu | Pirate Speech | 简体中文 (中国) | 繁體中文 (香港) | 繁體中文 (台灣) | T&uuml;rk&ccedil;e</span></p>\n\n<center>\n<h2> 🖼️ Media 🖼️ </h2>\n</center>\nCheck out some reviews here\n<br>\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/avG7OTcsJA0\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/vHQSjNacrm4\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n<center>\n<h2>❓ F. A. Q. ❓</h2>\n</center>\n\nQ: How do I disable/tweak X feature?\nA: Refer to the Customization section in the [Wiki](https://github.com/MehVahdJukaar/Supplementaries/wiki) or join our [Discord]()\n\nQ: Could you update/downgrade to X version?\nA: I plan to eventually port the mod to every new major Minecraft version so be patient.\nAs for downgrades absolutely no, I'm not interested in supporting older obsolete versions. Maintaining this one version already takes up so much of my time and so much changed between those versions that I would have to pretty much re-learn how to mod.\n\nQ: Could you add X feature/block?\nA: I would encourage you to join our Discord. We have a section dedicated to suggestions like that. If I'll feel like your idea fits well enough it will have a high chance to be eventually added.\n\nQ: How do I use X block/item?\nA: Once again refer to the Wiki.\n\nQ: How can I fix this issue/ crash?\nA: Please open a report in the Issues section always including a Crash Report.\n\nQ: Fabric version is missing X\nA: Supplementaries is a mainly a Forge Mod and if some feature is missing that means that it didnt have a simple or easy implementation as Fabric was missing a counterpart of something provided by Forge API that such feature was heavily reliant on.

However to view them directly in-game, insert a written Book named \"credits\" in a Notice Board.\nAlso some sounds are from Zapsplat so credit to them\n\n<center>\n\n## ❤️Support Me❤️\n</center>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Modding is taking a lot of my time, so if you like what I do, and you would like to support me, you can do so here.

Additionally, the dragon no longer spawns from the start - instead, it will be summoned once a player gets close to the bell tower in the center.</p>\n<p>To resummon the dragon, the 4 crystals no longer go right next to the portal. Instead, you'll see 4 bedrock blocks on the floor inside the tower, one in each directional wing of the building. The crystals can be placed on these 4 blocks to start summoning the dragon again. That being said, we do actually still support vanilla crystal summoning positions, to avoid confusing players who aren't familiar with the mod.</p>\n<p>The dragon's AI itself is unchanged.</p>\n<p><b>To use BEI on an existing world,</b> we've provided the <i>/end_island reset</i> command. Using this command while in the End will attempt to reset the dragon fight back to its initial state and replace any previous portal/pillars with our redesigned versions. But this command attempts some major things behind the scenes, so <b>please back up your world before trying!</b> Also note that <b>simply deleting your End dimension files is not suffificient, and you will still need to run the command.</b></p>\n<p>If you're having issues with the portal/tower spawning after using the command, such as the portal spawning under the island, you can use the full command `/end_island reset true` to attempt to place the portal on the surface again. But once again, back up your world before trying it! Seriously!</p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/D3LW5j7DAdE\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</p>\n<p>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/zMhFcqM.png\" alt=\"Compatibility\" width=\"1125\" height=\"59\" /><br />\nYUNG's Better End Island is intended to be compatible with as many mods as possible.

(See images for an example)</p>\n<p>If you find some sort of compatibility issue, please let me know!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em>You are free to use this mod in modpacks.</em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://discord.gg/S5NQjbXPnb\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/yX0xrk0.png\" width=\"200\" height=\"68\" /></a></p>\n<p><strong>Problems, feature request, something else?&nbsp; Join us on Discord!</strong></p>",

          "body": "![](https://i.imgur.com/yJbL99N.png)  \n\n### 🌲 About\n**Geophilic** is a data pack/mod that improves vanilla Overworld biomes in a subtle and simple way! Main inspiration comes from scrapped illustrations for what was supposed to be the *Wild Update* — this is essentially a collection of relatively light improvements to vanilla biomes without any new blocks, items, or even biomes.\n\nGeophilic adds variety to a host of biomes. You can find a plethora of new features, from simple fallen trees to forest clearings. There are boulders, tree stumps, bushes, moss, and more. Trees remain true to vanilla, with the one major change being how tall trees generate, so you don't bump your head so often!\n\nCare was taken to keep vanilla gameplay progression and feel. Geophilic does not make use of block palettes that would not be found in vanilla, nor does it add wood types to biomes they're not found in by default.\n\nIn short, this isn't meant to be an epic worldgen overhaul, but rather a simplistic and nice update to the feel of vanilla biomes.\n\n### 📦 Content\n**v3.0.0 and above,** almost every non-ocean biome gets an overhaul.\n\n**v2.4.0:** Badlands, Birch Forest, Cherry Grove, Dark Forest, Deep Ocean, Desert, Eroded Badlands, Flower Forest, Forest, Jungle, Meadow, Old Growth Birch Forest, Old Growth Pine Taiga, Old Growth Spruce Taiga, Plains, Savanna, Savanna Plateau, Snowy Plains, Snowy Slopes, Stony Shore, Sunflower Plains, Swamp, Taiga, Windswept Forest, Windswept Savanna, Wooded Badlands\n\nSee the gallery for pictures!\n\n### 📝 Notes\nFabric/Quilt mod version requires either **[Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api)** or **[Quilted Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/qsl)**!\n\nNew versions of the pack may differ slightly. I may make any changes, including the removal of features. While Minecraft can handle this and updating the mod won't corrupt your world, it's still good practice to make regular backups.\n\n### 🖥 Compatibility\nThis pack modifies only vanilla biome files, which means it's fully compatible with mods and data packs that do terrain, such as **[Tectonic](https://modrinth.com/datapack/tectonic)** or **[Lithosphere](https://modrinth.com/datapack/lithosphere)**!\n\nIf a data pack says it reworks vanilla biomes, it is likely partially or fully incompatible.\n\nCompatibility with **Terralith** is planned.\n",

For Forge, it's available for 1.12.2, 1.16.5, 1.18, 1.19 and 1.20!</p>\n<h4><strong>Frequently Asked Questions</strong></h4>\n<p>Q. How do I get support?<br>A. You can check out my Discord (linked below) or alternatively create an issue on our GitHub, which can be found by clicking on \"Issues\" above.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Q. What versions does Lootr support?<br>A. Currently, Lootr for Forge supports the following versions: 1.18, 1.19/1.19.1/1.19.2, 1.19.3. Please check the \"All Files\" page if you cannot find a download for the version of Minecraft you are playing.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Q. Is there a server-only version? Can I connect without installing it on the client?<br>A. No, <strong>Lootr is currently required on both the client and the server</strong>. If you have experience with plug-in development and are willing to help design a server-only version, please reach out on Discord (link found below).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Q. How do I change what loot is generated with Lootr? How do I include loot from other mods in Lootr containers?<br>A. <strong>This is beyond the scope of the Lootr mod</strong>, which simply changes the containers. In all other respects, loot is generated in exactly the same way as Vanilla chests generate it. Modifying loot tables is generally done via data packs, although various mods exist for various versions of Minecraft which do this. I recommend asking in your favourite modded Minecraft Discord or forum!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Q. What about dungeon mods? How do I prevent players from going in and looting everything after it has already been cleared?<br>A. There are a number of options that help with this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Specific loot tables can be blacklisted, which means that those chests will never be converted. You can also specify simply all loot tables of a certain mod. Likewise, specific dimensions can be blacklisted.</li>\n<li>Alternatively, you can specify for certain containers (or all containers), determined by their loot table, to \"decay\". This means that a configurable time after they are first opened, the next time someone attempts to open the container, the block will be destroyed. There also exists the opposite, a system whereby chests will \"refresh\" (or re-generate their contents) after the configured period of time has elapsed.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Q. How do I prevent players from simply breaking containers?<br>A. By default, players who attempt to break a container will be given a warning message and a reminder that all containers are available per-player. Players can still break these containers by doing so while sneaking, unless this option is disabled in the configuration.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Q. I don't like the visual appearance of the containers. How can I change this?<br>A. There is a client-side option that forces containers to use the default Vanilla skin. However, this does mean there is no visual change to indicate if a container has been opened before.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Q. Can I add Lootr to a pre-existing world and have containers be converted?<br>A. Yes! With one disclaimer: <strong>loot containers which were already opened will not be converted</strong>. The generation of loot in Minecraft, by default, removes the associated loot table, and there is no way for Lootr to find this information.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Q. The container from &lt;random mod&gt; isn't converting!<br>A. If the container contains items (or always contains the same items), it is possible that the mod is manually generating loot for it. In this case, there is no way for Lootr to determine a loot table and convert chests. I recommend asking the author of the mod to consider switching to a loot table instead to maintain compatibility! If the container is empty, it is possible that it is merely included for the aesthetic. Otherwise, if you believe there's an issue with conversion, please open an issue on our GitHub tracker or post on Discord. Additional methods for converting containers exist for 1.12.2.</p>\n<p><em>Please note that the \"axe chest\" in the Vanilla Woodland Mansion does not have an associated loot table and is never converted.</em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Q. I no longer want Lootr. What happens if I remove it?<br>A. <strong>Unfortunately, removing the mod will also remove all Lootr containers</strong>. There is currently no way to undo the conversion process.&nbsp;This means that every Lootr converted container will be removed from your world.<br><br></p>\n<p>Q. I want to create a \"starter\" chest with some items in it for everyone in my world, how do I go about this? How do I create my own Lootr container?<br>A. Lootr also contains \"custom\" inventories which use the same visual appearance as a chest. Simply create a Vanilla chest, fill it with the items you want available and then, while standing on it, execute the&nbsp;/lootr custom&nbsp;command (this requires operator privileges).&nbsp;<br><br></p>\n<p>Q. What else does the&nbsp;/lootr command do?<br>A. For a full explanation of the command, please check out the <a href=\"https://github.com/noobanidus/Lootr/wiki/Lootr-command\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lootr Command page on our GitHub Wiki</a>.<br><br></p>\n<p>Q. How do I use Lootr in a mod pack, or how do I natively use Lootr in my Mod?<br>A. For a full explanation of Lootr's features for mod packs, as well as the Lootr API, please check out the <a href=\"https://github.com/noobanidus/Lootr/wiki/Lootr-for-Developers\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lootr for Developers page on our GitHub Wiki</a>.<br><br></p>\n<p>Q. What do all the configuration options mean?<br>A. For a full explanation of Lootr's configuration, please check out the <a href=\"https://github.com/noobanidus/Lootr/wiki/Lootr-Configuration\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lootr Configuration page on our GitHub Wiki</a>.<br><br></p>\n<p>Q. Is there a video I can watch?<br>A. There sure is! <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCU3gwpclVZSYofj616OQKLQ\" rel=\"nofollow\">Vallen from Mischief of Mice</a> has graciously created this bit-by-bit video that covers the rough basics of Lootr, although this is from an earlier version of the mod and does not cover all recent additions:<br><span><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/hxSQWAaD8rk\" height=\"358\" width=\"638\"></iframe></span></p>\n<h4><strong>Patreon &amp; Discord</strong></h4>\n<p>You can <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/noobanidus\" rel=\"nofollow\">support me on Patreon!</a><br> All support for this mod is available on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://discord.gg/9YVkaee\" rel=\"nofollow\">my Discord.</a> You can also keep up with what I'm doing and get notifications streams!

The first and last point can't be moved though\n  \n  - Right click on a point to delete it\n\n- Small inventory to test your animation\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/ydZic5r4/images/5dbec7a2d372ea902d66e99fa4be88e36920f810.gif\"  height=\"512\">\n\n---\n\n[Forge downloads](https://modrinth.com/mod/smooth-swapping/versions?l=forge)\n\n[Fabric downloads](https://modrinth.com/mod/smooth-swapping/versions?l=fabric)\n\n\n",

We simply add onto Complementary so we obviously don't fall into the green zone. We have had many conversations about this topic with Emin and came to a mutual agreement to distribute it through a patcher where none of Emin's code gets distributed (and by that not breaking the license) and the user has to have Complementary Shaders installed in order to get our add-on. All parties profit from this method.\n## When does Euphoria Patches update?\nEuphoria Patches Updates Immediately after a new Complementary Version is out. This includes dev versions. Euphoria Patches dev versions are available on **[Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/spaceagle17)** or **[Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/SpacEagle17)**!\n\n</p>\n</details>\n\nSpecial thanks to Emin the developer of Complementary Shaders and all our testers on Discord! This project would have been impossible without you! Credits For Euphoria Patches can be found in-game or in the shaderpack files.  \nBanner by [Memokii](https://modrinth.com/user/swanslab)",

          "body": "# Bountiful\n\n \n\n#### This requires [Kambrik](https://modrinth.com/mod/kambrik)!\n\n***\n\n#### Bountiful is a mod centered around a single block called the Bounty Board, and items which appear within: Bounties!\n\n***\n\n\n \n\n### Mechanics:\n\nBounty boards can be found throughout the world in villages, and they'll generate bounties inside of them. These bounties often ask for you to bring back an item, or kill some mobs in return for whatever rewards they're offering. If you can complete the bounty, you just have to bring it back to the bounty board and right click the board to redeem your rewards!\n\n\n### Decrees\n\nThere exists another item as well, called a Decree. A Decree determines what kind of bounties show up on a bounty board. For example, an Armorsmith's Decree makes it so that objectives and rewards related to armor show up on the board (leather, iron, chestplates, boots, etc). You can have up to three decrees on a bounty board at once, and it will mix and match objectives and rewards from all three when new bounties appear!\n\nYou can find new Decrees as rewards for certain bounties, or make your own. Crafting your own will create a random decree when you place it onto the board.\n\n### Bounty Tiers\n\nJust like items, bounties can have different tiers of rarity. Some bounty rewards are more rare than others, and bounties with higher rarity have a better chance of having these more rare rewards! Rarity follows the same pattern as in vanilla: Common, Uncommon, Rare and Epic.\n\n### Reputation\n\nAll bounty boards have their own value associated with them called \"Reputation\". As you turn in more bounties, this number goes up! The higher the reputation, the more often rare bounties show up on the bounty board. Some bounty rewards may not even show up until you reach high enough reputations.\n\n### Compat\n\nCurrently, I've added some support for some items from different Fabric mods. Feel free to suggest compat with other Fabric mods (but I may be stingy! For example: I'm not likely to add compat with items that involve a lot of time to craft, since it may break progression for some modpacks).\n\n \n\nI plan on adding more in the future!\n\n### Why?\n\nI originally made this mod so that I could be given some goals to accomplish, which would stave off boredom. It gives players something to do when they're bored, and a fun way to incentivize crafting items they'd otherwise maybe not be making!\n\n### Help\n\nUntil the wiki is complete, you can get help on [my Discord server.](https://discord.gg/TCsRjJ6vwZ)\n\n#### Credits:\n\nAkiShirai, for the wonderful bounty board block art.",

This mod contains shared code that are used across multiple mods, as well as some platform helpers, to make Porting and Multiple Mod Loader support easier during development.\n\nThis mod does not do anything on its own, and requires a \"Module\" (or Mod that relies on this library) to perform any work. Other developers are welcome to use this library for their own projects, but keep in mind that it's primarily designed for our usage, and does not always contain all the features that other library mods contain.\n\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; \n\n![](https://cdn.firstdark.dev/artpacks/craterlib/craterlib_artwork_help.jpg)\n\nWhen things go wrong, and they definitely do from time to time, you can open an Issue on Github if it's a bug or suggestion, or for quicker support, you can join our discord and ask your question in the appropriate channel\n\n&nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n**The artwork contained on this page is licensed under All Rights Reserved (by HypherionSA) and may not be re-used anywhere else, aside from our official Curse/Modrinth/Documentation pages.

This is useful for modpacks that want to advertise themselves, or for people who simply want a nicer way to show that they are playing Minecraft. \n\nThis mod works out of the box, but you can customize it to suit your needs. Please refer to the WIKI above for more info\n\n![](https://cdn.firstdark.dev/artpacks/srpc/srpc_config.jpg)\n\nHate editing config files by hand? Why not try out the simple to use, [Config Editor App](https://editor.firstdark.dev/) designed for Simple RPC. This app allows you to edit the config file step by step and even includes a Preview to show you what your Rich Presence will look like.\n\n![](https://cdn.firstdark.dev/artpacks/srpc/srpc_help.jpg)\n\nYou can always refer to the [WIKI](https://srpc.fdd-docs.com) for help, but while I try to keep everything as simple as possible and keep the docs as useful as possible, sometimes things go wrong or it just doesn't make any sense. \n\nYou are more than welcome to open an Issue on Github if it's a bug or suggestion, or for quicker support, you can join our discord and ask your question in the appropriate channel\n\n![](https://cdn.firstdark.dev/artpacks/srpc/srpc_perms.jpg)\n\nIf it wasn't clear from the description, you are allowed to use this mod in your modpack. You are not allowed to Sell or rehost this mod elsewhere.

Real Magic! ⛄\n\nThis simple tweak mod can enrich the vanilla snow layer's behavior.\n\nWith this mod you can:\n\n - Place snow and fence/wall/tallgrass in the same block!\n - The snow layer will fall like sand. If it touches the water source, it will become ice!\n - The snow layer will accumulate during a snowstorm!\n - The snow layer will have a thinner bounding box like in the Bedrock edition!\n - Reduce fall damage on snow!\n - Make snow always replaceable by other blocks!\n - Crouch + right-click snow to make a snowball\n - Make snow never melt (disabled by default)\n - Make snow fall on ice (disabled by default)\n - And more!\n \nAll features can be disabled in the config.\n\nTo work with Sodium, you need to install Indium.\n\n[![Interested in supporting me and the development of mods?

          "body": "![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ochotonida/artifacts/1.18/src/main/resources/logo.png)\n\nSome older versions of this mod can be found on curseforge: [Forge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/artifacts) /  [Fabric](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/artifacts-fabric)\n\nArtifacts is a mod which aims to make exploration more rewarding by adding various powerful items that cannot be crafted.\n\nThe items added by this mod can be found in chests in vanilla structures, through archaeology, or can very rarely be found worn by entities. All artifacts only have a few chests in which they can be found, so go out and explore! Additionally, a new underground campsite structure has been added. Mimics occasionally spawn in these campsites instead of a chests, which are dangerous enemies that attack players that get too close. Mimics always drop a random artifact when killed.\n\nEvery item added by this mod has a unique model when equipped. The full set of items and their descriptions can be found in the images tab. Sn up-to-date list of where each item can be found is available on the wiki on GitHub.\n\n![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37985539/118691060-fdaaa400-b808-11eb-97c8-2f45ef277c52.png)\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n\n#### _Some items are too powerful, is there some way I can change that?_\n\nArtifacts adds various game rules that allow you to change or completely disable the effects of all items added by the mod.\nIn versions for Forge 1.19.2 and below, most of these config options are located in the server config. Unlike the client and common config files, server config files are located in your world save's _serverconfigs_ folder. Preventing specific items from spawning in chests is currently not possible without creating a data pack, but it is possible to change how rare artifacts are in general using the artifactRarity (for items in chests) and campsite count/mimicChance (for mimics) config options.\n\n#### _How do I change the amount of slots for my artifacts?_\n\nIf you're using the Forge version, It is possible to change the number of slots of each type using the Curios server config. The '/curios' command can also be used to add/remove slots for one specific player. If you want to change the slot an artifact can be placed in, you will need to create a data pack and change the item tags that determine the artifact's slot types.\nMore information on how to do all of these things can be found on the [Curios wiki](https://github.com/TheIllusiveC4/Curios/wiki/How-to-Use:-Users).\n\nIf you're using the Fabric version, modifying the number of slots players have requires creating a data pack. Information about the data formats used can be found on the [Trinkets wiki](https://github.com/emilyploszaj/trinkets/wiki/Trinkets-Data-Formats).\n\n#### _Which mod are you using to put artifacts on armor stands?_\n\n[Curious Armor Stands](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/curious-armor-stands \"\").\n\n#### _Can I still find artifacts if I add this mod to a world that has already been generated?_\n\nCampsites and mimics will only spawn in chunks that were generated after you downloaded the mod. You will still be able to find artifacts in unopened chests in existing chunks.\n\n#### [Forge] _Whey I try to open the Curios menu to equip my artifacts, nothing happens._\n\nSome server plugins can cause this (https://github.com/TheIllusiveC4/Curios/issues/131). If you're using plugins, verify that this issue also happens in a Forge-only environment before asking for help.\n\n[![](https://discordapp.com/api/guilds/298798089068609537/widget.png?style=banner2)](https://discord.gg/87pXJadaRr)",

It adds many new particles, any of which you can enable/disable at will. You can also completely enable/disable the mod via the config too!\n\nThere is also a special underwater explosion effect for when an explosion occurs underwater. You can make it so that there are lots of bubbles during an underwater explosion for a very satisfying effect!\n\n## Dependencies\n\n**Requires** Fabric API and YetAnotherConfigLib.  \nAlso requires Mod Menu if you wish to edit the config.\n\n[![Requires Fabric API](https://i.imgur.com/OIHAigX.png)](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api)",

This allows the explosions to be lit up in darker areas, and even has some bonus effects when using shaders(depending on the shader pack, sorta an accidental feature honestly but I like it). The smoke particles fade from completely emissive to the correct light level based on how long it has been since the explosion.\n\nIf you find any issues, please report them on Explosive Enhancement's GitHub!

The Library's code base is also tested in a wider range of circumstances and communities which can lead to less bugs and better performance in mods.</p>\n\n<h3>Features for Players</h3>\n<p>While this mod is primarily for mod authors, there are a few useful features for Players.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Darkhax-Minecraft/Bookshelf/wiki/Commands\" rel=\"nofollow\">Debug commands</a> like /bookshelf hand to get item IDs.</li>\n<li>Many new <a href=\"https://github.com/Darkhax-Minecraft/Bookshelf/wiki/Data-Packs\" rel=\"nofollow\">datapack features</a> like crafting recipes that damage items with durability rather than consuming them.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Features for Modders</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Darkhax-Minecraft/Bookshelf/blob/1.16.5/src/main/java/net/darkhax/bookshelf/serialization/Serializers.java\" rel=\"nofollow\">Serialization for JSON/Network/NBT formats.</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Darkhax-Minecraft/Bookshelf/tree/1.16.5/src/main/java/net/darkhax/bookshelf/util\" rel=\"nofollow\">Utility Functions.</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Darkhax-Minecraft/Bookshelf/tree/1.16.5/src/main/java/net/darkhax/bookshelf/registry\" rel=\"nofollow\">Registry manager, including non-forge registry types, debugging, and statistics.</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Darkhax-Minecraft/Bookshelf/wiki/Commands\" rel=\"nofollow\">Debug commands.</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Darkhax-Minecraft/Bookshelf/wiki/Data-Packs#recipe-types\" rel=\"nofollow\">New recipe types.</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Darkhax-Minecraft/Bookshelf/wiki/Data-Packs#ingredients\" rel=\"nofollow\">New ingredient types.</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Darkhax-Minecraft/Bookshelf/wiki/Data-Packs#loot-conditions\" rel=\"nofollow\">New loot condition types.</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Darkhax-Minecraft/Bookshelf/wiki/Data-Packs#global-loot-modifiers\" rel=\"nofollow\">New loot modifier types.</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Darkhax-Minecraft/Bookshelf/wiki/Data-Packs#item-predicates\" rel=\"nofollow\">New item predicates.</a></li>\n<li>Check <a href=\"https://github.com/Darkhax-Minecraft/Bookshelf\" rel=\"nofollow\">GitHub</a> and the <a href=\"https://github.com/Darkhax-Minecraft/Bookshelf/wiki\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wiki</a> for more!</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Like the mod and want to support me?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Follow me on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DarkhaxDev\" rel=\"nofollow\">Twitter</a></li>\n<li>Join my <a href=\"https://discord.darkhax.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Discord</a></li>\n<li>Check out my <a href=\"https://darkhax.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\">website</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n[![Nodecraft sponsor banner](https://assets.blamejared.com/nodecraft/darkhax.jpg)](https://nodecraft.com/r/darkhax)\n\n**This project is sponsored by Nodecraft.

It should generate `kubejs` folder in your minecraft directory with example scripts. startup scripts only get run once when the game loads. Those are for registering items, setting up configs etc. Server/data scripts are loaded when you join a world, those are better for things like clearlag, displaying custom login messages and world/player related things in general.\n\n## Can I reload scripts?\nYes, use `/reload`. Note: Not everything is reloadable. Some things require you to restart game, some only world, some work on fly.\n\n## I don't know JavaScript / I need help with this mod\nThere's examples and pre-made scripts on [KubeJS Wiki](https://kubejs.com/).\n\n## How does this mod work?\nIt uses [Rhino](https://modrinth.com/mod/rhino), a JavaScript engine originally by Mozilla.\n\n## Ok, but what if it.. doesn't work?\nYou can report issues on [Here](https://kubejs.com/support?source=kubejs).\n\n## I have more questions/suggestions!\nIf wiki didn't have the answer for what you were looking for, you can join the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/lat) and ask for help in one of the `#support` channels!\n\n[![](https://kubejs.com/discord.png)](https://discord.gg/lat)",

You can find the Forge mod [here.](https://modrinth.com/project/farmers-delight/)\n## This port is only for 1.20.1+, if you want a Fabric port for older Minecraft versions, you can find it [here.](https://modrinth.com/project/farmers-delight-fabric/)\n\n## Have any issues with this port? Refer to us directly on either of these discords instead:\n<a href=\"https://discord.gg/qdKRTDf8Cv\"><img src=\"https://github.com/MehVahdJukaar/dynamic_badges/blob/master/discord.svg?raw=true\" alt=\"Supplementaries Discord\" width=\"255\" height=\"88\" /></a><a href=\"https://discord.greenhouseteam.dev/\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/J6hJYtZ.png\" alt=\"Greenhouse Discord\" width=\"224\" height=\"96\" /></a>\n\n\n### Oh and as a bonus, for the time being, the mod comes with an extra feature, **Skillet Burger Flipping**. Just press left click when cooking anything on a skillet or use a shovel on a placed down one!\n\n**🌽 Description**\n\n**Farmer's Delight** is a mod that gently expands upon farming and cooking in Minecraft.\n\nUsing a simple cooking system and a few familiar ingredients, you'll be able to prepare a wide variety of hearty meals: from sandwiches to salads and stews, from beautiful desserts to mouth-watering feasts, no ingredient will be left behind in your kitchen!\n\nIt also introduces a rich set of utilities: a way to **improve the very soil** your crops grow in, a brand new kind of tool to **scavenge resources** with, cute **decorations** for your builds, and many blocks and items to help you on your adventure!\n\nIt's time to farm a little bit of everything!\n\n \n**📖 Getting Started**\n\n**Follow the advancements!** Much of its progression is described through them. By default, press the (L) key to open the Advancements screen.\n\nIf you'd rather get a more straight-forward guide, we wrote a [Getting Started](https://github.com/vectorwing/FarmersDelight/wiki/Getting-Started) to help you learn the basics!\n\n \n**📝 FAQ**\n<details>\n<summary>Expand for FAQ</summary>\n\n**Q. How does this different from the other existing Farmer's Delight Fabric?**\n\nA. This port's main focus has been on simplicity and faithfulness to the original mod. This meant that only minor changes were made to accommodate the loader specific things.\n\nPackage names and all existing behavior has been kept the same. This means that FD addons can now easily be ported from Forge to Fabric with, ideally, no change at all as all the package names are the same.\n\n[A list of differences can be found here.](https://github.com/MehVahdJukaar/FarmersDelight/blob/1.20/information/Differences.md)\n\n**Q. Will existing addons work for this?**\n\nA. While porting existing Forge addons to Fabric will be trivial, already existing Fabric addons made for the old Fabric port will NOT work and they will have to update to reflect the new package structure.\n\n[A list of supported addons and integrations can be found here.](https://github.com/MehVahdJukaar/FarmersDelight/blob/1.20/information/Addons_And_Integrations.md)\n\nFeel free to ask for more compat layers, however, they will only be done if they are simple enough to be able to be done, anything more complicated and you're best to wait for a developer to support Farmer's Delight Refabricated or just accept that they might not, it's really up to them.\n\n**Q. Can I use this mod into my modpack?**\n\nA. Yes! Feel free to feature Farmer's Delight in your modpack, and customize it as you see fit for the experience you're crafting. Just keep in mind:\n\n- Make sure to credit, and don't claim Farmer's Delight as your own creation;\n- Always read the changelogs! Minor and major versions can sometimes have breaking changes, which will be explained there.\n\n**Q. Will I keep old blocks from the other FD port?**\n\nA. The mods use the same IDs so yes.\n\n**Q. Will addons for the other port be updated to use this one instead?**\n\nA. That depends on them. Updating/porting a Forge addon is trivial but this will still take a bit of time and depends on the individual modder. So please be patient and don't harrass modders.\n\n**Q. Which Minecraft versions will the mod be updated for?**\n\nA. Farmer's Delight Refabricated is currently being updated for 1.20+. Any other versions are currently discontinued.\n\n**Q. Are you going to backport this mod to versions before 1.15?**\n\nA. No. This mod will never be backported to older versions. The game's older codebases are entirely different, and usually missing important features this mod depends on.\nPlease, do NOT ask for backports!\n</details>",

You have a purse in your Inventory which holds your riches - these may be obtained from killing Pillagers, exploring the world and its ancient ruins and, of course, trading with Villagers.\n\n<center><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/eaZwQtf.png\"/></center>\n\nSpeaking of Villagers, these have also been completely reworked. First of all, they obviously trade Currency instead of Emeralds. However, their trades have also been rebalanced and tweaked to provide a more interesting trading experience.\n\n<center><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/7wDkasS.png\"/> </center>\n\nOne last feature is the **Shop**, which serves as an easy way to trade items between players. When opened, it displays a Villager GUI with trades the owner can configure. When someone buys something, the money will be stored within and can be retrieved by the owner.",

We want to introduce new players to atlas, and make it easier to maintain and improve.<br/>\n`0.x` uses arch, keeps the old `antiqueatlas` ID, and is API-compatible with [tyra's port](https://modrinth.com/mod/antique-atlas).<br/>\n`1.x` uses fabric, and is API-incompatible with 0.x.<br/>\n`2.x` uses fabric and [Surveyor](https://modrinth.com/mod/surveyor) - and is save/API/network/respack-incompatible with older versions.<br/>\n\nOnce stable and feature-complete, we intend to maintain atlas on most modpack versions >=1.18.2 ([more info](https://github.com/sisby-folk/antique-atlas/issues/81))\n\n## Afterword\n\nAll mods are built on the work of many others.\n\nThe art for antique atlas was created by [Hunternif](https://github.com/Hunternif) ([DA](https://www.deviantart.com/hunternif)) and [lumiscosity](https://github.com/lumiscosity) ([Neocities](https://lumiscosity.neocities.org/)).<br/>\n[Click here](https://github.com/sisby-folk/antique-atlas/blob/1.20/credits.txt) for detailed art credit.\n\nThis mod is a fourth-gen rewrite, and relies heavily on contributions of many developers and artists before us.<br/>\nWe can't draw autotile to save our lives - feel free to [contribute](https://github.com/sisby-folk/antique-atlas/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Atexturing)!\n\nThis mod is included in [Tinkerer's Quilt Plus](https://modrinth.com/modpack/tinkerers-quilt) - our modpack about rediscovering vanilla.\n\nWe're open to suggestions for how to implement stuff better - if you see something wonky and have an idea - let us know.\n\n---\n\n<center>\n<b>Tinkerer's:</b> <a href=\"https://modrinth.com/modpack/tinkerers-quilt\">Quilt</a> - <a href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/tinkerers-smithing\">Smithing</a> - <a href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/origins-minus\">Origins</a> - <a href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/tinkerers-statures\">Statures</a> - <a href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/picohud\">HUD</a><br/>\n<b>Loveletters:</b> <a href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/inventory-tabs\">Tabs</a> - <i>Atlas</i> - <a href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/portable-crafting\">Portable Crafting</a> - <a href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/drogstyle\">Drogstyle</a><br/>\n<b>Others:</b> <a href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/switchy\">Switchy</a> - <a href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/crunchy-crunchy-advancements\">Crunchy</a> - <a href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/starcaller\">Starcaller</a><br/>\n</center>\n",

While bricks can crack, they can be repaired as simply as using some mortar on them. Moss will never grow back if you burn it away with Flint and Steel. Significant attention has been paid to how these mechanics can impact your gamplay and as such we've made sure you can prevent or repair any potential damage. ",

This datapack holds its charm by adding no new biomes, items, mobs, structures, etc... a simple datapack to just make the vanilla Nether better.\n\nAdditionally, Amplified Nether brings back the Nether mountains from the original official Minecraft Nether Update trailer. Many players saw these beautiful mountains, and were upset that they weren't in the game. 3D biomes are used extensively, with much more biome variation. Biome borders that were previously impossible are now commonplace, as any biome can border any other biome!\n__ __\n\n[![Patron Ad](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63272345/224786738-7baefaf8-267f-41b6-8ac5-53cc4bd5707e.png \"Join our Patreon!\")](https://www.patreon.com/stardustlabs)\n\n[![Bisect Hosting Ad](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63272345/224786219-f87f21d2-fb51-4d78-82df-a16e83fe25c9.png \"Use code STARDUST\")](https://www.bisecthosting.com/stardust)\n    ",

That is, to be simplicity and faithfulness to the original mod by minimize changes to those has to be done to accommodate the loader specific things.\n\n  Package names and all existing behavior has been kept the same. This is important for mods that compiles against the mod's code, as they can be either easily ported or built using a multiloader project. A exmaple could be the planned Fabric version of [Create: Central Kitchen](https://modrinth.com/mod/create-central-kitchen).\n\n  Another important point for players and pack-makers is that this port is open-sourced under LGPL v2.1 and available both on CurseForge and Modrinth. See the \"Can I use this mod in my modpack?\" part for details.\n\n  <b>Q: Can I use this mod in my modpack?</b>\n  \n  A: Feel free to use this mod in your modpack and even build your own custom version to match the needs, if you follow these terms:\n  - Make sure to credit the author(including the Forge version's author), and don't claim Nether's Delight as your own creation;\n  - Permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the mod is granted under the terms of the licenses of the mod. You may check the `LICENSING.md` file in the mod jar or source repository for details.\n\n  <b>Q: Is it safe to switch to this port using old saves?</b>\n\n  A: IDs are kept unmodified, so yes.\n\n  <b>Q: Which Minecraft versions will the mod be updated for?</b>\n\n  A: Nether's Delight Refabricated is currently being updated for 1.20+. Future updates will be maintained following the Forge version's updates.\n</p></details>\n\n",

This mod is intended for nostalgic enthusiasts who want to relive the glory days of Minecraft Java edition by tweaking the mod to their nostalgic preference.\n\nSome of the major nostalgic tweaks included are **old classic and pre-beta 1.8 light engines**, **old fog rendering**, **old sky and void colors**, **2D floating items with disabled diffused lighting**, **old mob spawning**, **old combat mechanics**, **old game screens**, **old C418 music**, and **so much more**! There are currently over **400+** nostalgic tweaks as of 2.0.0-Beta 9 with more on the way!\n\nFor the best nostalgic experience, I recommend using the **[Golden Days](https://github.com/PoeticRainbow/golden-days/releases)** resource pack by **PoeticRainbow**. It comes with an abundance of nostalgic packs, such as an alpha and picture perfect pack which coincides wonderfully with **Nostalgic Tweaks**. Additionally, use the **[Modern Beta](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/modern-beta)** mod by **b3spectacled** or **[Moderner Beta](https://modrinth.com/mod/moderner-beta)** by **BlueStaggo** for nostalgic terrain generation.\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/q5ZA0VvJSIM\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n![Separator](https://i.imgur.com/kdL3fYl.png)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/1QUJE8z.png)\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/7zD7n5s.png\" width=\"300\" height=\"50\">\n\nThis mod will only be distributed on [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/nostalgic-tweaks) and **Modrinth**. I **cannot** guarantee the integrity of the mod if downloaded from anywhere else. Reuploads of this mod is **strictly prohibited**.\n\n# Mod Description\n\n**You can safely add and remove this mod from worlds at any time**. In version **2.0.0** there are five major categories; **Sound**, **Eye Candy**, **Gameplay**, **Animation**, and **Swing**. Some of these categories will have their own subcategories that clump together related tweaks. Read the configuration section below to learn how to change tweaks in this mod.\n\nThis mod does **_not_** add any textures, so it is recommend to have the [Golden Days](https://github.com/PoeticRainbow/golden-days/releases) resource pack by **PoeticRainbow** installed. _The order of your resource packs matters_. Make sure **Programmer Art** is under Golden Days.\n\nThe mod currently has over **400+** nostalgic tweaks that can all be used in singleplayer and/or multiplayer. There are descriptions below each tweak's name in the mod's config menu. Tweaks that are controlled by the server are tagged as such in the mod's config menu.\n\n# Configuration\n\nTo open the mod's config menu, press **O** for \"**Old**\" while in-game or at the game's title screen. This hotkey can be changed in the vanilla controls menu or in the mod's config menu. If you have **[Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu)** installed for Fabric, then you can also access the configuration screen through the **Mods** button.\n\nEach tweak will have **tags** above their names in the config menu. Each tag identifies different aspects of each tweak. You can hover your mouse over each tag to see more information as a tooltip. You can favorite the tweak, see its status, modify the client/server value, save, undo, reset, and modernize a tweak within its configuration box.\n\nThe config menu comes with searching capabilities. Search queries that are typed into the input box will bring up fuzzy results. This means the mod will attempt to show results that it believes you were trying to search for. You can narrow search results by using **Search Tags**. To see all the search tags that are available, open the config menu and click the **Manage** button in the bottom-left corner of the screen. Then go to the \"Help\" category and scroll down.\n\nThe config menu also comes with keyboard shortcuts. **Ctrl + F** focuses the search box, **Ctrl + S** saves the config menu, **Esc** exits the config menu, and **Ctrl + Left Arrow**, **Alt + Left Arrow**, **Ctrl + Right Arrow**, or **Alt + Right Arrow** will change the category group you are in without the need to click on a category button. You can also use the **Tab** key and **Directional Arrow** keys to cycle through and navigate the various widgets in the menu. Press the **Spacebar** key or **Enter** key to perform an action on the highlighted element.\n\n# Compatability\n\nThis is a list of commonly reported problems and their potential solutions:\n\n- If you are experiencing issues with chunks not updating light changes (_usually caused by mod conflicts_), then disable the `Round Robin Chunk Relighting` tweak. This can be found under `Eye Candy > Lighting Candy > World Lighting > Light Engine`.\n- Optifine is known to cause problems. It is a closed source mod, so it is very difficult to support. Tweaks that are known to be impacted by Optifine are tagged in the config menu.\n- Sodium & Embeddium are officially supported.\n\nIf you experience a crash or come across a compatibility issue, please let me know! It is best to report compatibility issues on our **[GitHub](https://github.com/Adrenix/Nostalgic-Tweaks/issues)** issue page for better tracking.\n\n# FAQ\n\n### Does this mod have a dedicated discord server?\n\nYes we do! And this is definitely a place where you can come by to share ideas, report issues, and/or just hangout to see what's new.\nhttps://discordapp.com/invite/jWdfVh3\n\n### What resource pack is used in the demo video and screenshots?\n\nIt is the [Golden Days](https://github.com/PoeticRainbow/golden-days/releases) resource pack by **PoeticRainbow**. There is also a button in the mod's settings homepage that links the resource pack as well.\n\n### Can I include this mod in my pack?\n\nIf your mod pack is distributed on CurseForge or Modrinth, then yes!\n\n### Is this mod server safe?\n\nYes! The mod is designed to disable tweaks that are not allowed on non-modded servers.\n\n### Will there be any backport to version 1.x.x?\n\nNot for Nostalgic Tweaks. Use my previous mod **[OSECA](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/old-swing)**, for versions 1.12, 1.16, and 1.17.\n\n### I ran into an issue running this mod.\n\nPlease make a report at our [Github](https://github.com/Adrenix/Nostalgic-Tweaks/issues) or [Discord](https://discord.gg/jWdfVh3).\n",

You first create an instance of `RegistrationHelper` using your mod's ID, then register items using its helper functions.\n\n```java\npublic static final RegistrationHelper register = new RegistrationHelper(MOD_ID);\n\n// Generic item\npublic static final Item ITEM_A = register.item(\"item_a\");\n// Custom item with generic item settings\npublic static final Item ITEM_B = register.item(\"item_b\", MilkBucketItem::new);\n// Generic item with custom item settings\npublic static final Item ITEM_C = register.item(\"item_c\", new FabricItemSettings().maxCount(1));\n// Custom item\npublic static final Item ITEM_D = register.item(\"item_d\", new EnderPearlItem(new FabricItemSettings().maxCount(16)));\n```\n\nFor comparison, here it is without the registration helper.\n\n```java\npublic static final Item ITEM_A = Registry.register(Registries.ITEM, new Identifier(MOD_ID, \"item_a\"), new Item(new FabricItemSettings()));\n\npublic static final Item ITEM_B = Registry.register(Registries.ITEM, new Identifier(MOD_ID, \"item_b\"), new MilkBucketItem(new FabricItemSettings()));\n\npublic static final Item ITEM_C = Registry.register(Registries.ITEM, new Identifier(MOD_ID, \"item_c\"), new Item(new FabricItemSettings().maxCount(1)));\n\npublic static final Item ITEM_D = Registry.register(Registries.ITEM, new Identifier(MOD_ID, \"item_d\"), new EnderPearlItem(new FabricItemSettings().maxCount(16)));\n```\n\n### Lavender Extensions\n\nYou can extend [Lavender](https://modrinth.com/mod/lavender) with new markdown features by adding `\"sushi_features\": true` to your book definition, it currently features:\n\n- 2x2 crafting grid\n  - e.g. `<recipe_2x2;minecraft:crafting_table>`\n- 1x1 crafting grid\n  - e.g. `<recipe_1x1;minecraft:oak_planks>`",

This will work for vanilla biomes, as well as modded biomes. Because of the nature of adding biomes via datapacks, you'll have to generate a new world once for the spawnbiomes.txt config file to generate. After that you can select which biomes players should spawn in by removing the exclamation mark in front of the line with the biome name.<br><br>The bonus chest world generation feature is compatible. If enabled, another bonus chest will be placed around the biome spawn position.<br><br>This mod is compatible with <span style=\"color:#396;font-size:18px\"><a style=\"color:#396;font-size:18px\" href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/village-spawn-point\" rel=\"nofollow\">Village Spawn Point</a></span>.<br></span><strong><br><br><span style=\"font-size:18px\">The spawnbiomes.txt Config File</span>:<br></strong><span style=\"font-size:14px\">A config file is generated in <em>./config/biomespawnpoint/spawnbiomes.txt</em>. By removing an exclamation mark in front of the biome name, it will add a chance for players to spawn in that biome. When one is selected, it has a 100% chance. When two are selected, they each have a 50% chance.</span><strong> <br><br><img src=\"https://github.com/Serilum/.cdn/raw/main/projects/biome-spawn-point/a.png\"><br></strong></p>\r\n<p><br>------------------<br><br><span style=\"font-size:24px\"><strong>You may freely use this mod in any modpack, as long as the download remains hosted within the Modrinth ecosystem.</strong></span><br><br><span style=\"font-size:18px\"><a style=\"font-size:18px;color:#008000\" href=\"https://serilum.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Serilum.com</a> contains an overview and more information on all mods available.</span><br><br><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Comments are disabled as I'm unable to keep track of all the separate pages on each mod.</span><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><br>For issues, ideas, suggestions or anything else there is the&nbsp;<a style=\"font-size:14px;color:#008000\" href=\"https://github.com/Serilum/.issue-tracker\" rel=\"nofollow\">Github repo</a>.

With Create, the game isn't played inside a bunch of UIs, it challenges you to setup contraptions of animated components working together in many possible arrangements.</p>\n<p>Create's visual in-game documentation called 'Ponder' will guide you though all added mechanics and gadgets.</p>\n<p><strong>Important</strong>: In order to be able to see all recipes required in Create, consider installing a Recipe Viewer mod. Create has full support for <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/jei\">JEI</a>, <a href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/rei\">REI</a>, and <a href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/emi\">EMI</a>. The vanilla recipe book will not be able to guide you through the experience by itself.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/Fabricators-of-Create/Create/issues\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/qPmjSXy.png\" width=\"160\" /></a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrKV2QTuyGcv4E3eSJpBiYA/playlists\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/L1bU9mr.png\" width=\"160\" /></a><a href=\"https://discord.gg/hmaD7Se\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/uf6V9ZX.png\" width=\"160\" /></a> <a href=\"https://github.com/Creators-of-Create/Create/wiki/Supporting-the-Project\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/fHQ45KR.png\" width=\"227\" /></a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n## Development\n\n<p>Find out about supported versions and what's currently in the works in <a href=\"https://github.com/Creators-of-Create/Create/wiki/dev.status\">this dedicated wiki page.</a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n### Developers\n\n<p>simibubi, Jozufozu, Pepper, Zelophed, gamez7, Grimmauld, Snownee</p>\n\n### Porters\n\n<p>Pepper, Tropheus Jay, AlphaMode, smellypengu, Aeiou, Whangd00dle, YTG123</p>\n\n### Artists\n\n<p>Kryppers, voxel_dani, LeastReality, vectorwing</p>\n\n### Special thanks to\n\n<p>tterrag, evanthebruce, D'Arcy Olla</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n## Localization\nTranslations may be unfinished or out of date.\n\n* en_us (English US)\n* de_de (German) by Vexatos, Azratosh, SaurierZockt, DreiMu, muffinbarde, Peatral\n* nl_nl (Dutch) by Prusias\n* fr_fr (French) by Kiro, dindin-glitch\n* zh_cn (Chinese) by TUsama, BigDaleAHA, gloomybanana, Snownee, MacrousHyucen, Demonese, StarFish\n* zh_tw (Chinese, Traditional) by dunois\n* ru_ru (Russian) by sqcode06, Hanqnero, sirabein, pgkrol, Alepod\n* pt_br (Brazilian) by lucassabreu, vyhi\n* jp_jp (Japanese) by MORIMORI0317, CKenJa, RakuGaki-MC\n* ko_kr (Korean) by qkrehf2, red1854th\n* it_it (Italian) by Masterlupo, Chexet48\n* es_es (Spanish) by FrannDzs, muriplz\n* es_mx (Spanish, Mexico) by JohanIvan\n* es_cl (Spanish, Chile) by Alonsinwhat\n* pl_pl (Polish) by joker876\n* ro_ro (Romanian) by andreutu",

Well, now that's possible! MC Dungeons Artifacts (MCDAR) aims to (eventually) bring all of these artifacts, and more, from Minecraft Dungeons to Minecraft.\n\n# Content\nRight now, there are more than 25 artifacts added to the game ranging from the explosive Blast Fungus to protective Totem of Shielding. They have been divided into Villager and Illager artifacts and can be found in either villages, mansions, pillager outposts, or dungeons. These artifacts cannot be crafted as it is assumed that the Villagers and Illagers have exclusive knowledge of how to make these magical items.\n\n## Related Mods\nWould you like weapons as well? Well, check out [MC Dungeons Weapons](https://modrinth.com/mod/mcdw)!\n\nWould you like armors as well?

They were instrumental to the inspiration and education needed to produce MC Dungeons Artifacts and the rest of MCDX (the MC Dungeons Suite).\n\n## SeaOfPixels\nThe continuing improvement to the visuals of this mod would not be possible without [Sea of Pixels](https://powerups4u.wixsite.com/seaofpixels). He has licensed his amazing art for MC Dungeons Armor and has worked with us to balance out some of the issues with MCDA as well. SeaOfPixels has allowed for his amazing models and textures from his resource pack [New Default+](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/newdefaultplus) to be used in MCDA. Please show him some support and check it out! If you like CIT texture packs, I'm sure that you'll have a blast!\n\nTexture and model used: Lightning Rod\n\n## SattesKrokodil\nSattes made the amazing drop art for the various mobs as well as the crafting art. Check him out at his [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/sattes) or check out the [Adventure Pack](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/fabric-adventure-pack)! We'd love to see you over there!\n\n## BackupCup\nCup is an amazing pixel artist and is a budding Kotlin programmer. Thanks to them, we have a new suite of icons for MCDX and the icon for MCDAR is thanks to them! Please check out their projects [here](https://modrinth.com/user/BackupCup)!\n\n\n# Localisations/Translations\nWould you like to have MC Dungeon Artifacts translated into your language? Please submit your translation on the GitHub page and I'd be glad to add it!\n- English - `en_us` - [Chronos_Sacaria](https://modrinth.com/user/Chronos_Sacaria)\n- Spanish (Mexican) - `es_mx` - Binaris00\n- Simplified Chinese - `cn_zh` - [Chronos_Sacaria](https://modrinth.com/user/Chronos_Sacaria)\n- Russian - `ru_ru` - Inky & [Iamnotagenius](https://modrinth.com/user/Iamnotagenius)\n\n# Patrons\nWithout my patrons, I would not be able to devote as much time as I do to making these mods.\n\n## Special thanks to\n- Deona (Custom)\n- 7z99 (Claymore)\n- EmmyAllEars (Claymore)\n- purejosh (Sword)\n- OnlyANeko (Sword)\n\n# FAQ\n- Q: Why does MCDAR not work with Optifine?\n  - A: Optifine's code is closed source and extremely invasive. This is not a bad thing, in and of itself; but it makes it almost impossible to troubleshoot anything whilst still respecting the licencing that sp614x uses. So, out of respect for them so as to not have to explore their code without permission, we simply do not support it. Please consider the following alternatives:\n    - FPS Enhancement and Optimisations -- [Sodium](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium) (Fabric); [Rubidium](https://modrinth.com/mod/rubidium) (Forge)\n    - Shaders -- [Iris](https://modrinth.com/mod/iris) (Fabric); [Oculus](https://modrinth.com/mod/oculus) (Forge)\n    - Rendering Compatibility -- [Indium](https://modrinth.com/mod/indium) (Fabric); [Reforgium](https://modrinth.com/mod/reforgium) (Forge)\n- Q: Can I use your mod in my modpack?\n  - A: Absolutely! I only ask that you provide a link back to this page.\n- Q: I've seen your mod on other sites. Did you post it and are they safe?\n  - A: I have not, nor do I plan to, post my mod on any other sites than Modrinth, Curseforge or our GitHub page. If you have downloaded this mod from somewhere else: \n    1. It isn't from us \n    2. It may have some kind of malicious files or have been modified in some way. I urge you to delete the file, run a full virus and malware scan and, if you want to use MC Dungeons Artifacts, come and download it on Modrinth, CurseForge or from GitHub.\n- Q: 1.12.2?\n  - A: Given the massive strides that have been made with Minecraft's code since 1.12 and the subsequent changes to the underlying code, a 1.12.x port is simply untenible. Please see this [link](https://howoldisminecraft1122.today/) for more information.\n- Q: Will the mod be ported to 1.x.x?\n  - A: MC Dungeons Weapons, MC Dungeons Armors and MC Dungeons Artifacts are only developed for the latest version of Minecraft. Backports should not be expected.\n- Q. Forge?\n  - A. MC Dungeons Artifacts is compatible with Forge by using the following mods: [Sinytra Connector](https://modrinth.com/mod/connector), [Connector Extras](https://modrinth.com/mod/connector-extras) and the [Forgified Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/forgified-fabric-api) which are being developed by Su5eD. Please make sure to follow all of their instructions in order to have the best experience.\n  - Note: If you wish to use [Clumps](https://modrinth.com/mod/clumps), please make sure to use the Fabric version as we rely on a method that is not present in the Forge version.\n  - If you are looking for a mod that was specially built for Forge with similar content, please consider checking out [Dungeons Gear](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/dungeons-gear) by the_infamous_1.",

This can be used by mod packs and servers to define custom recipes and other features for a wide range of mods. It can also be used to change textures, override tooltips, and change other aspects of the game.</p>\n\n<h3>Data Packs</h3>\n<p>Data packs are used by Minecraft to load recipes, loot tables, functions, and other game mechanics. Many mods also pull from data packs to handle custom recipe systems and other new mechanics. OpenLoader will load any data packs that are placed in the ~/config/openloader/data folder. Before 1.17 they were loaded from ~/openloader/data instead. OpenLoader can load zipped and folder packs. You can learn more about data packs <a href=\"https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Data_pack\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<h3>Resource Packs</h3>\n<p>Resource packs are used to define textures, translations, sounds, and other client data. You can use them to override existing resources or add completely new ones. These packs are loaded from the ~/config/openloader/resources folder. Before 1.17 they were loaded from ~/openloader/resources instead. OpenLoader can load zipped or unzipped packs.&nbsp;You can learn more about resource packs <a href=\"https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Resource_pack\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<h3>FaQ</h3>\n<p><strong>Does this support mods like Patchouli or BotanyPots?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes, packs loaded by this mod will behave exactly like packs loaded through the vanilla systems. So anything that works through the normal resource packs folder or the world datapack folder will work here.</p>\n\n<p><strong>My pack is not loading?</strong></p>\n<p>If your pack is not loading it is because you have not followed the instructions properly or have made an invalid pack. Make sure you have the file placed in the right folder and that your pack has a valid pack.mcmeta file. Unfortunately I do not have the time or resources to help you debug your packs, but there are countless resources and communities available to help you make these things.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How does pack load order work?</strong></p>\n<p>Any resource packs loaded by OpenLoader should be loaded after vanilla and modded resource packs. Data pack load orders are done on a per-world basis instead and can be very annoying. Initially all data packs loaded by this mod will be loaded after vanilla and modded packs. Any mods added to the game after that initial world load will load after all previously loaded packs but only for that world. This can be fixed by using Vanilla's data pack command to correct the world order on a per-world basis. If you need more consistent control over load order I would recommend a scripting tool like <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/crafttweaker\" rel=\"nofollow\">CraftTweaker</a> which is more robust and stable than the data pack system.</p>\n\n<h3>Files</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/open-loader/versions?l=forge\" rel=\"nofollow\">Forge</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/open-loader/versions?l=fabric\" rel=\"nofollow\">Fabric</a><a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/dark-paintings/files/all?filter-status=1&filter-game-version=2020709689:7499\" rel=\"nofollow\"><br></a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Like the mod and want to support me?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Follow me on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DarkhaxDev\" rel=\"nofollow\">Twitter</a></li>\n<li>Join my <a href=\"https://discord.darkhax.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Discord</a></li>\n<li>Pledge on <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/Darkhax\" rel=\"nofollow\">Patreon</a></li>\n<li>Check out my <a href=\"https://darkhax.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\">website</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n[![Nodecraft sponsor banner](https://assets.blamejared.com/nodecraft/darkhax.jpg)](https://nodecraft.com/r/darkhax)\n**This project is sponsored by Nodecraft.

Instead when in a world run the <code>/config showfile &lt;modid&gt;</code> command by choosing either <code>CLIENT</code> or <code>SERVER</code> (depending on the mod), then click the file name (ending with .toml) that appears in chat to be able to manually edit the config file in a separate editor. After saving the file, the config will automatically reload in-game after a couple of seconds, so no game restart required.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: Where can I download this mod for Fabric on versions of Minecraft before 1.19?</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> Older downloads are found on the <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/visual-workbench-fabric\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>old project page</strong></span></a>.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: Does this work with crafting tables from other mods?</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> Yes, it does, but support has to be manually enabled per block. Many modded crafting tables are supported by default, those that are not can be added to a custom config file found at <code>.minecraft/config/visual_workbench.json</code> (not accessible from in-game). If you add a crafting table yourself and it doesn't work it is likely incompatible with this mod.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: Now that items stay in the table, clearing the interface is so tedious. What can I do?</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> Try <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/crafting-tweaks\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Crafting Tweaks</span></a>, a mod by <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/members/blaytheninth\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>BlayTheNinth</strong></span></a>.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: Can you backport to 1.12?</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> No, but check out the original <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/realbench\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">RealBench</span></a> mod by <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/members/prototik\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Prototik</strong></span></a>.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/GDRRfHI.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\"><strong>🏆 Credits:</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Developing <strong>Visual Workbench</strong> was helped and inspired by:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/members/prototik\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Prototik</strong></span></a> for the original idea and most of the rendering code from their <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/realbench\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">RealBench</span></a> mod</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/members/tfarecnim\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Tfarecnim</strong></span></a> for the <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/jei\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">JEI</span></a> plugin code from their <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/crafting-station\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Crafting Station</span></a> mod</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Daomephsta</strong> from the Fabric Discord for pointing me into the right direction for supporting modded crafting tables on Fabric</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/GDRRfHI.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;

          "description": "Sodium addon providing support for the Fabric Rendering API, based on Indigo",
          "body": "Indium is an addon for the rendering optimisation mod [Sodium](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium), providing support for the Fabric Rendering API. The Fabric Rendering API is required for many mods that use advanced rendering effects, and is currently not supported by Sodium directly. Indium is based upon the reference implementation Indigo, which is part of Fabric API with source available [here](https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric/tree/1.17/fabric-renderer-indigo). (licensed Apache 2.0)\n\n# Frequently Asked Questions\n## Which mods require Indium?\nAny mod that uses the Fabric Rendering API will require Indium when used with Sodium. These include: Campanion, Bits and Chisels, LambdaBetterGrass,\nContinuity, Packages, and many more. Some of these mods may function without an implementation of the Fabric Rendering API, but have broken textures and models.\n\n## Does Indium affect performance?\nIndium's impact on performance should be negligible, however mods that use the Fabric Rendering API could themselves impact performance. Indium will not provide a performance benefit over using only Sodium.\n\n## Is Indium a replacement for Sodium?\nNo, Indium is an addon mod for Sodium - you must use both mods together to get Fabric Rendering API support with Sodium's rendering optimisations.\n\n## Do I need Indium if I don't use Sodium?\nNo, Indigo is provided as part of Fabric API as the reference implementation of the Fabric Rendering API. Indigo disables itself when Sodium is installed.\n\n## Is Fabric API required?\nYes. To use Sodium with mods that require the Fabric Rendering API, you need *both* Fabric API to provide the rendering API and Indium to implement the rendering API.\n\n## Will it be merged into Sodium?\nFabric Rendering API support is not currently a priority for the Sodium developers, and will not be explored until Sodium is in a more stable state.\n\n## Which versions of Sodium are supported?\nSodium 0.2.0 or newer is required for all versions of Indium. I support the latest stable versions of Sodium for 1.18 and 1.19. Iris may not always be compatible with the latest release or build of Indium - please ask the Iris support channels if you have issues.",

          "body": "![SuperMartijn642's Config Lib](https://imgur.com/oVcLlAO.png)   \n**SuperMartijn642's Config Lib** allows you to **specify a config once** and it then **handles reloading values between world loads, syncing values with clients**, and **generating values for client- or server-only** on its own.\n\n---\n\n### Creating a config:\nA config is created using a `ModConfigBuilder`.\nSimply create a new instance using `#ModConfigBuilder()`.\n```java\n   ModConfigBuilder builder = new ModConfigBuilder();\n```\nA value can be added to the config with `ModConfigBuilder#define` which takes a name and a default value.\nFor integer and double values a minimum and maximum value are also required.\n`ModConfigBuilder#define` returns a `Supplier` which should be stored to retrieve the value from the config.\n```java\n   Supplier<Boolean> booleanValue = builder.define( \"booleanValue\", true );\n\n   Supplier<Integer> integerValue = builder.define( \"integerValue\", 5, 0, 10 );\n\n   Supplier<Double> doubleValue = builder.define( \"doubleValue\", 0.5, 0, 1);\n\n   Supplier<ExampleEnum> enumValue = builder.define( \"enumValue\", ExampleEnum.VALUE_1 );\n```\nA comment can be added to a value by calling `ModConfigBuilder#comment(String)` before defining the value.\n```java\n   Supplier<Boolean> valueWithComment = builder.comment( \"this is a comment for 'valueWithComment'\" ).define( \"valueWithComment \", true );\n```\nBy default values are reloaded when world is loaded.\nThis can be changed to only reload a value when Minecraft launches by calling `ModConfigBuilder#gameRestart()` before defining the value.\n```java\n   Supplier<Boolean> notReloadedValue = builder.comment( \"this is value will not be reloaded\" ).define( \"notReloadedValue\", true );\n```\nValues in COMMON or SERVER configs are synchronized with clients by default, to prevent this use `ModConfigBuilder#dontSync()`.\n```java\n   Supplier<Boolean> notSynchronizedValue = builder.comment( \"this is value will not be synchronized\" ).define( \"notSynchronizedValue\", true );\n```\nValues can also be put into categories.\n`ModConfigBuilder#push(String)` pushes a category and `ModConfigBuilder#pop()` pops a category.\n```java\n   builder.push( \"special\" );\n   \n   Supplier<Boolean> specialValue = builder.comment( \"this value is in the 'special' category\" ).define( \"specialValue\", true );\n   \n   builder.pop();\n```\nA comment can be added to the active category using `ModConfigBuilder#categoryComment(String)`.\n```java\n   builder.push( \"client\" ).categoryComment( \"this, is a comment for the 'client' category\" );\n```\nAfter defining all values `ModConfigBuilder#build()` must be called to finish the config.\n```java\n   builder.build();\n```\nNow the values in your config will reloaded and synced automatically and the values can be retrieved using the stored `Supplier` instances.\nThis will work for all available versions, that includes Minecraft 1.12, 1.14, 1.15, 1.16, 1.17, 1.18, and 1.19.\n\n---\n\n### Example Mod:\nFor a concrete example of how to use Config Lib checkout [the example mod](https://github.com/SuperMartijn642/SuperMartijn642sConfigLib/blob/1.16/src/test/java/ExampleModConfig.java).\n\n---\n\n### FAQ\nCan I use your mod in my modpack?  \nYes, feel free to use my mod in your modpack\n\n---\n\n### Discord\nFor future content, upcoming mods, and discussion, feel free to join the SuperMartijn642 discord server!  \n[<img width='400' src='https://imgur.com/IG1us6p.png'>](https://discord.gg/QEbGyUYB2e)\n",

It's possible to set items to any specific slot in the inventory, to the offhand and to the armour slots. The mod can detect which players have never joined before. If another mod adds items, such as guide books, they can either be removed completely or added after the kit has been set. This is configurable via the <em>addExistingItemsAfterKitSet</em> config option.<br><br>Can be used in a server for all new players or in singleplayer to start off with a default inventory of your choosing. There is also optional support for FTB's Team Island mod after the create island command.<br><br>The mod can be used <strong>server-side only</strong>. If you want players to be able to use the \"Choose Kit GUI\", it has to be installed on the client as well. Alternatively, they can choose kits via server commands.<br><br><span style=\"font-size:24px\"><strong>Features:</strong></span><br>&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp; A guide here in the description. Difficulty ranging from <strong>Simple</strong>, <strong>Intermediate</strong> and <strong>Advanced</strong>.<br>&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp; Give players joining the world for the first time custom starter items and/or potion effects.<br>&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp; Support for multiple kits. Can be given randomly or chosen by the player.<br>&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp; There is custom tracking to determine who are new players, compatible with existing worlds.<br>&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp; Lots of commands! For creating, adding, managing and choosing starter kits.<br>&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp; If installed on the client, kits can be chosen via a custom GUI screen. If not, commands can be used.<br>&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp; Add descriptions to your kits. RPG modpack, anyone?<br>&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp; Remove other modded starter items, such as guide books. Or add them after the starter kit.<br><br></span></p>\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size:24px\">Configurable:</span> <span style=\"color:#008000;font-size:14px\"><a style=\"color:#008000\" href=\"https://github.com/Serilum/.information/wiki/how-to-configure-mods\" rel=\"nofollow\">(&nbsp;how do I configure?&nbsp;)</a></span><br></strong><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><strong>randomizeMultipleKitsToggle</strong> (default = true): When multiple starter kits are added via /starterkit add, there are two ways to distribute them. With this enabled, one is chosen at random. When disabled, players can choose one on first join.<br><strong>addExistingItemsAfterKitSet</strong> (default = true): Whether items that existed in the inventory, such as books added by other mods, should be added back to the inventory after the kit was set. If disabled, they'll be removed. You can still manually set them via the kit.<br><strong>usePotionEffectsInStarterKit</strong> (default = true): If potion/mob effect functionality should be enabled. This means that when creating a kit via /sk (add/set), it also saves the active effects the player has. And when handing out the starter kits, it adds the effects to new players.<br><strong>formatKitNames</strong> (default = true): If kit names should be formatted. Each word will be capitalized.<br><br><strong>chooseKitScreenHeader</strong> (default = \"%s, you can choose a starter kit!\"): The text used above the kit choice screen, or if the mod is not installed in the chat. %s will be replaced with the player's name.<br><br><strong>announcePlayerKitChoiceInDedicatedServer</strong> (default = true): Whether an announcement should be broadcasted to the server whenever a new player makes a kit choice. 'randomizeMultipleKitsToggle' must be disabled, and there must be at least 2 starter kits available.<br><strong>enableFTBIslandCreateCompatibility</strong>&nbsp;(default = true): Whether the starter kit should be re-set after the '/ftbteamislands create' command from FTB Team Islands. Does nothing when it's not installed.<br></span></p>\r\n<p><br><span style=\"font-size:24px\"><strong>Commands:</strong></span><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><em><br>Both '/starterkit' and '/sk' can be used.</em><strong><br><br><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Admin Commands:</span></strong></span><br><span style=\"font-size:14px\">/sk add (kit_name)</span> - <em>Adds your current inventory to the active kits.</em><br><span style=\"font-size:14px\">/sk set (kit_name)</span> - <em>Sets your current inventory as the only active kit.</em></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\">/sk give &lt;player&gt; (kit_name)</span> - <em>Give a player a random (or specific) starter kit.</em></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\">/sk activate &lt;kit_name&gt;/_all</span> - <em>Moves kit_name or all kits from inactive to active.</em><br><span style=\"font-size:14px\">/sk deactivate &lt;kit_name&gt;/_all</span> - <em>Moves kit_name or all kits from active to inactive.</em></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\">/sk list (inactive)</span> - <em>Lists all active (or inactive) kits.</em><br><span style=\"font-size:14px\">/sk reset</span> - <em>Resets all tracking.

To keep a better overview, I've divided the difficulty into three different sections. <strong>Simple</strong>, <strong>Intermediate</strong> and <strong>Advanced</strong>.<br></span><br><span style=\"font-size:18px\"><strong>Simple:</strong></span><br><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Set a custom starter kit. Add/Remove starter items from other mods. And giving players a starter kit via commands.</span><br><br><span style=\"font-size:18px\"><strong>Intermediate:</strong></span><br><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Add an extra starter kit. Deactivate a kit via commands. Add a starter kit with potion effects, and setting the level and duration.</span><br><br><span style=\"font-size:18px\"><strong>Advanced:</strong></span><br><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Make players choose a kit on first join. Move the inactive default kits to active. Show the choose kit GUI screen. Create a starter kit with a custom description.</span><br><br><br><span style=\"font-size:36px\"><strong>Section 1: <span style=\"font-size:36px\">Simple</span></strong></span><br><span style=\"font-size:14px\">This is the default starter kit, which will be given when the mod is installed without any configuration:</span><br><img src=\"https://github.com/Serilum/.cdn/raw/main/projects/starter-kit/0.png\"><br><br><span style=\"font-size:14px\">You can set your own starter kit by using the '<em><strong>/starterkit set (kit_name)</strong></em>' (or '<em><strong>/sk set (kit_name)</strong></em>') command. The kit name is optional.</span><br><span style=\"font-size:14px\">After using this command, all other active starter kits are moved to the inactive folder.</span><br><img src=\"https://github.com/Serilum/.cdn/raw/main/projects/starter-kit/1.png\"><br><br><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Here you can see the new starter kit data file that was created with the previous command. It's located in '<em><strong>./config/starterkit/kits/</strong></em>':</span><br><img src=\"https://github.com/Serilum/.cdn/raw/main/projects/starter-kit/2.png\"><br><br><span style=\"font-size:14px\">That's it! All new players will now receive the \"<strong>Upgraded</strong>\" kit when they first join the world:</span><br><img src=\"https://github.com/Serilum/.cdn/raw/main/projects/starter-kit/3.png\"><br><br><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Inside the config file, located at '<em><strong>./config/starterkit.json5</strong></em>', you can choose whether or not other modded starter items should be removed or given after the kit.</span><br><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Examples of these modded starter items are guide books.</span><br><img src=\"https://github.com/Serilum/.cdn/raw/main/projects/starter-kit/4.png\"><br><br><span style=\"font-size:14px\">To give other players (or yourself) a starter kit manually, you can use the '<em><strong>/starterkit give &lt;player&gt; (kit_name)</strong></em>' command.</span><br><span style=\"font-size:14px\">The kit_name argument is optional, if left out:</span><br><span style=\"font-size:14px\">If the mod is configured via intermediate, a kit may be given randomly.</span><br><span style=\"font-size:14px\">If the mod is configured via advanced, the kit choice screen may be shown.</span><br><img src=\"https://github.com/Serilum/.cdn/raw/main/projects/starter-kit/5.png\"><br><br><br><br><span style=\"font-size:36px\"><strong>Section 2: <span style=\"font-size:36px\">Intermediate</span></strong></span><br><span style=\"font-size:14px\">You can add another active kit by using the '<em><strong>/starterkit add (kit_name)</strong></em>' command.</span><br><span style=\"font-size:14px\">With the default configuration, this means that new players will now randomly receive the \"<strong>Default</strong>\" or \"<strong>No Bread</strong>\" starter kit.</span><br><img src=\"https://github.com/Serilum/.cdn/raw/main/projects/starter-kit/6.png\"><br><br><span style=\"font-size:14px\">To see all active starter kits, use the '<em><strong>/starterkit list</strong></em>' command. To see inactive starter kits, use '<em><strong>/starterkit list inactive</strong></em>':</span><br><img src=\"https://github.com/Serilum/.cdn/raw/main/projects/starter-kit/7.png\"><br><br><span style=\"font-size:14px\">To disable an active kit, use '<em><strong>/starterkit deactivate &lt;kit_name&gt;</strong></em>'. This moves it to the '<em><strong>./config/starterkit/kits/inactive/</strong></em>' folder.</span><br><img src=\"https://github.com/Serilum/.cdn/raw/main/projects/starter-kit/8.png\"><br><br><span style=\"font-size:14px\">The mod can also give potion effects alongside the starter kit! Make sure '<strong>usePotionEffectsInStarterKit</strong>' is enabled in the config.</span><br><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Then, just make sure to have the potion effect enabled, and use the '<em><strong>/starterkit set</strong></em>' or '<em><strong>/starterkit add</strong></em>' command.</span><br><span style=\"font-size:14px\">The effect duration will be set to what the player has exactly now, but we will round that up in a later step.</span><br><img src=\"https://github.com/Serilum/.cdn/raw/main/projects/starter-kit/9.png\"><br><br><span style=\"font-size:14px\">For this example, I've given the player the speed potion effect. This was active when using the previous command:</span><br><img src=\"https://github.com/Serilum/.cdn/raw/main/projects/starter-kit/10.png\"><br><br><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Locate and open the kit we've just created. The path is '<em><strong>./config/starterkit/kits/Speed_Kit.txt</strong></em>':</span><br><img src=\"https://github.com/Serilum/.cdn/raw/main/projects/starter-kit/11_1.png\"><br><br><span style=\"font-size:14px\">This is the data file for the \"<strong>Speed Kit</strong>\" kit. It contains the items the player will receive and at the bottom what effects will be given to the player.</span><br><span style=\"font-size:14px\">When a kit is created without active effects, that line will be empty. Otherwise it copies the exact level and duration.</span><br><span style=\"font-size:14px\">In case of this example, it contains a reference to the Speed effect. It's <strong>lvl 1</strong> with a duration of <strong>3341 ticks</strong>, which equals 167 seconds. <strong>20 ticks = 1 second</strong>.</span><br><img src=\"https://github.com/Serilum/.cdn/raw/main/projects/starter-kit/11_2.png\"><br><br><span style=\"font-size:14px\">I'm going to change the effect a player will receive to <strong>Speed level 5</strong>, with a duration of <strong>5 minutes</strong>. 6000 ticks = 300 seconds = 5 minutes:</span><br><img src=\"https://github.com/Serilum/.cdn/raw/main/projects/starter-kit/12.png\"><br><br><span style=\"font-size:14px\">You can reload any changes you've made to files inside '<em><strong>./config/starterkit/</strong></em>' via the '<em><strong>/starterkit reload</strong></em>' command:</span><br><img src=\"https://github.com/Serilum/.cdn/raw/main/projects/starter-kit/13.png\"><br><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><br>That's it! Whenever a player first joins a world, they will now receive the \"<strong>Speed Kit</strong>\" kit. Which contains a few standard items and the <strong>Speed V</strong> effect, with a duration of <strong>5 minutes</strong>:</span></p>\r\n<details><summary>Show Spoiler</summary>\r\n<p><img src=\"https://github.com/Serilum/.cdn/raw/main/projects/starter-kit/14.gif\"></p>\r\n</details>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<br><br><br><span style=\"font-size:36px\"><strong>Section 3: <span style=\"font-size:36px\">Advanced</span></strong></span><br><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Starter Kit also contains a custom kit choosing screen! Here's an example of what it looks like with the \"<strong>Default</strong>\" kit.</span><br><span style=\"font-size:14px\">In this section we'll enable this, create a kit and add a description for it.</span><br><img src=\"https://github.com/Serilum/.cdn/raw/main/projects/starter-kit/15_1.png\"><br><br><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Disable the \"<em><strong>Randomize Multiple Kits Toggle</strong></em>\" inside the config. Remember, it's located inside '<em><strong>./config/starterkit.json5</strong></em>'. You can also use the in-game config editor for this:</span><br><img src=\"https://github.com/Serilum/.cdn/raw/main/projects/starter-kit/15_2.png\" width=\"1143\" height=\"664\"><br><br><span style=\"font-size:14px\">There are some default kits located inside the '<em><strong>./config/starterkit/kits/inactive/</strong></em>' folder. Let's enable those for this example.<br>Use the '<em><strong>/starterkit activate _all</strong></em>' command to activate all inactive kits.</span><br><img src=\"https://github.com/Serilum/.cdn/raw/main/projects/starter-kit/16.png\"><br><br><span style=\"font-size:14px\">You can use the '<em><strong>/starterkit list</strong></em>' command to see which kits are currently active:</span><br><img src=\"https://github.com/Serilum/.cdn/raw/main/projects/starter-kit/17.png\"><br><br><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Since everything contains default values, you can immediately see it working! Load a new world, and you'll be shown the choose kit screen:</span></p>\r\n<details><summary>Show Spoiler</summary>\r\n<p><img src=\"https://github.com/Serilum/.cdn/raw/main/projects/starter-kit/18.gif\"></p>\r\n</details>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<br><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Let's add our own custom kit, and see how the descriptions work.<br>Start off with an inventory of your choosing, and use the '<em><strong>/starterkit add</strong></em>' command.<br>I'm calling it \"<strong>Pumpkin</strong>\".</span><br><img src=\"https://github.com/Serilum/.cdn/raw/main/projects/starter-kit/19.png\"><br><br><span style=\"font-size:14px\">All kit descriptions are saved inside '<em><strong>./config/descriptions/</strong></em>'. These are automatically created whenever you create or add a kit.</span><br><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Open the description file with the kit name you've just set. In my case, the file is '<em><strong>./config/descriptions/Pumpkin.txt</strong></em>'.</span><br><img src=\"https://github.com/Serilum/.cdn/raw/main/projects/starter-kit/20.png\"><br><br><span style=\"font-size:14px\">This is the default description content for any newly created kit.<br>The description is used for the <strong>choose kit screen</strong>, and the '<strong>/starterkit info &lt;kit_name&gt;</strong>' command.</span><br><img src=\"https://github.com/Serilum/.cdn/raw/main/projects/starter-kit/21.png\"><br><br><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Change the description to whatever you'd like! There isn't a size limit, but any overflow will be hidden. So make sure it's not too long:</span><br><img src=\"https://github.com/Serilum/.cdn/raw/main/projects/starter-kit/22.png\"><br><br><span style=\"font-size:14px\">To reload the changes we've made to the description file, use the '<em><strong>/starterkit reload</strong></em>' command:</span><br><img src=\"https://github.com/Serilum/.cdn/raw/main/projects/starter-kit/23.png\"><br><br><span style=\"font-size:14px\">That's it! The description will now be visible on the choose kit screen:</span><br><img src=\"https://github.com/Serilum/.cdn/raw/main/projects/starter-kit/24.png\"><br><br><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Click on the \"<strong>Choose Starter Kit</strong>\" button, and receive the selected kit:</span><br><img src=\"https://github.com/Serilum/.cdn/raw/main/projects/starter-kit/25.png\"><br><br><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><strong>Starter Kit can automatically detect if the mod has been installed on the client.</strong></span><br><span style=\"font-size:14px\">There is support for server-side only use. In that case, players can choose a kit via commands.</span><br><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Whenever the server doesn't get a response from the client, meaning the mod isn't installed, the following message is sent on first join:</span><br><img src=\"https://github.com/Serilum/.cdn/raw/main/projects/starter-kit/26.png\"><br><br><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Players can use the '<em><strong>/starterkit info &lt;kit_name&gt;</strong></em>' command to see which items are included in the starter kit:</span><br><img src=\"https://github.com/Serilum/.cdn/raw/main/projects/starter-kit/27.png\"><br><br><span style=\"font-size:14px\">A kit can be chosen with the '<em><strong>/starterkit choose &lt;kit_name&gt;</strong></em>' command:</span><br><img src=\"https://github.com/Serilum/.cdn/raw/main/projects/starter-kit/28.png\"><br><br>------------------<br><br><span style=\"font-size:24px\"><strong>You may freely use this mod in any modpack, as long as the download remains hosted within the Modrinth ecosystem.</strong></span><br><br><span style=\"font-size:18px\"><a style=\"font-size:18px;color:#008000\" href=\"https://serilum.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Serilum.com</a> contains an overview and more information on all mods available.</span><br><br><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Comments are disabled as I'm unable to keep track of all the separate pages on each mod.</span><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><br>For issues, ideas, suggestions or anything else there is the&nbsp;<a style=\"font-size:14px;color:#008000\" href=\"https://github.com/Serilum/.issue-tracker\" rel=\"nofollow\">Github repo</a>.

Compared to vanilla, Better Fortresses are much larger, more complex, and more rewarding. Each fortress is comprised of three parts — the bridge networks, the Keep, and the Lava Halls that extend deep underground.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>YUNG's Better Nether Fortresses also includes built-in Create compatibility!</b> If you're using Create, certain parts of the fortress have a chance of spawning using Create pieces. Note that this is an optional feature — Create is not required to run this mod. Be sure to use the latest release of Create for your Minecraft version! Note that this is for 1.19.2+ only.\n</p>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/omRqM-gZBAg\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<p>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/3wUhXJJ.png\" alt=\"Compatibility\" width=\"1125\" height=\"59\" /><br />\nYUNG's Better Nether Fortresses is intended to be fully compatible with every worldgen mod, including:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a title=\"YUNG's Better Ocean Monuments\" href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/yungs-better-ocean-monuments\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">YUNG's Ocean Monuments</a></li>\n<li><a title=\"YUNG's Better Witch Huts\" href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/yungs-better-witch-huts\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">YUNG's Better Witch Huts</a></li>\n<li><a title=\"YUNG's Extras\" href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/yungs-extras\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">YUNG's Extras</a></li>\n<li>Infernal Expansion, Better Nether & other Nether biome mods</li>\n<li>Apocalyptic Fortress: The AF fortress will spawn alongside the Better Fortress</li>\n<li>Bygone Nether: Better Fortresses will spawn instead of Bygone Nether's enhanced vanilla fortress</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/a49IMQJ.png\" /><br />\n<a title=\"Get 25% off your server with code YUNGNICKYOUNG at Bisect Hosting!\" href=\"https://bisecthosting.com/yung\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/nQRs7ZP.png\" alt=\"Use code YUNGNICKYOUNG with Bisect Hosting for 25% off!\" width=\"1344\" height=\"400\" /></a></p>",

This will name old and new spawns in the world. The mod contains a list of 5000+ names, one of which will be randomly chosen whenever an unnamed villager is detected. The profession of the villager is also visible on the trade screen. You can also use your own custom name lists, see below. There are various config options available to determine what should and shouldn't be shown on the villager trade screen. Professions will be localized in the game language.<br><br>The mod can also name modded villagers!

TIMM adds biome specific music, the plan is to eventually add 10-15 unique songs for each biome, as well as to also add structure and event based music in the future. There are currently over 50 brand new songs included in the current build of the mod with more being added with each update.\n\n\n# The Music\n \nThe music is composed by two individuals and it looks to capture the spirit of each biome and structure in similar style to C418.\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6neRfMlUMGU\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n\n# Copyright\n\nFeel free to use any and all these songs in Youtube videos, Twitch streams, and so on, as either a part of gameplay or a backing track. The copyright license is just to protect against people using the music and charging other users for it. I.E. if your audience has to pay to access your content, and you are using our music, that does infringe on the copyright. Other than that, we are more then happy to allow everyone using this mod to share the music with their audiences and friends.\n\n\n# The Team\n\nThe mod was conceptualized by Nate (aka Gold Eagle) and is coded by Tape (tape_os on Discord). Music featured in this mod is composed by [Gold Eagle](https://www.youtube.com/@goldeagleproductions) as well as [Caner Crebes](https://www.youtube.com/@cannercrebes2262)\n\n# Mod Commands\n\n- `/skip [song name]` (Skips the current song, if no song is provided the mod will pick a new one)\n- `/timmstop` or `/stp`  (Stops playing the current song and does not play a new song) \n- `/np` or `/nowplaying` (Displays the song that is currently playing)\n- `/cfg` (Opens a config. menu where you can adjust things such as song delay)\n",

          "description": "The vanilla friendly End update we never had",
          "body": "![Banner](https://i.imgur.com/F3n8Le3.png)\n\n![Separator](https://i.imgur.com/dovXyIK.png)\n\n### I always really liked the End dimension. And always waited for it to finally get some love and get updated.\n### **Except... It never was. So I decided I'd do it myself.**\n\nThe goal for End's Phantasm is to make the End dimension a place the player has an interest in going to, and for it to be better integrated into the main game loop. Survival starting from the End is also made possible.\n\nShine bright, like the stars above!\n\n![Separator](https://i.imgur.com/dovXyIK.png)\n# Biomes\n\n<details>\n<summary>Dreaming Den</summary>\n\nFor now, **Phantasm** adds one new biome, the **Dreaming Den**.\n\nSee this strange looking forest? Silently watched over by the Fallen Stars of the End sky, grow *Vivid Nihilium* and *Pream Trees*. These last have yellow and blastproof wood, just like Endstone! They also yield *Pream Berries* from their foliage, which also *heal* you when eaten.\n\n![Dreaming Den](https://imgur.com/b0s18s7.png)\n\nNow let's look at the other side of the mirror. *Below the Dreaming Den* is the *Underisland*, which could be considered a sub-biome. The roof is covered in *Oblivion*, a strange void corrupted moss that can be used as a repair material for anything, and *Oblivines*. You can latch to them not to fall, and they grow *Oblifruits*, which have a chance not to be consumed on use!\n\n![Underisland](https://imgur.com/8v4KUl1.png)\n\nLastly, scattered both above and below the biome are glowing *Crystal Spikes*. They are mainly useful for crafting decorative blocks, but the ones below the islands have a chance to be Voided, which can be crafted into tools that mine faster the more experience you have, acting as an upgrade to gold.\n\nIn this new place spawn two new mobs, the **Crystie** and the **Behemoth**\n\nCrysties are little crystal fairies, with an explosive filiation with End Crystals. Would you dare to hit one, it would then attempt to dive straight into you to explode in a sparkly bang, or simply when it dies.\n\nBehemoths are lazy giants sleeping anywhere on the ground of the Dreaming Den. Be careful though, as getting too close will wake them up, and they're quite grumpy!\nThey are immune to knockback and ranged attacks, but drop powerful physical enhancing meat when defeated.\n\n\n</details>\n\n\n# General Changes\n\n<details>\n<summary>The End</summary>\n\nFirst of, one thing might quite surprise you: when jumping in the End portal, you don't spawn directly on the main island, ready to face the Dragon (unless you turned this off in the configs).\nThat is because *the portal now brings you to the outer End islands*. To go fight the Dragon, you simply have to wander around a bit and find a Gateway that will take you to the fight. This simple but decisive change finally brings the End in the main game loop, as it allows more casual players to explore it as an extra step before \"finishing the game\".\n\nBecause of this, *the Elytra has been nerfed* and can't be boosted until the Dragon is killed. You still get to enjoy gliding around, but it's not so overpowered.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Obsidian Towers</summary>\n\nThe Obsidian Spires around the Dragon got a slight redesign by having a *Crying obsidian gradient* near the top. It doesn't do anything, but it emphasizes well the magicalness of the Crystals.\n\nSome of theses Towers also *randomly spawn in the outer End as new dungeons*. What is inside is still a work in progress, but you can find some nice loot and a challenging experience!\n\n![Obsidian Tower](https://imgur.com/bs3asPX.png)\n\n</details>\n\n\n\n![Separator](https://i.imgur.com/dovXyIK.png)\n\n[![Join the Discord!](https://imgur.com/YYnr9MS.png)](https://discord.gg/khZnX8TRHU)\n[![Partner](https://imgur.com/PsNSmwr.png)](https://www.kinetichosting.net/)\n\n",

Examples include:\n\n- Exposing functionality that is useful but difficult to access for many mods such as particles, biomes and dimensions\n- Adding events, hooks and APIs to improve interopability between mods.\n- Essential features such as registry synchronization and adding information to crash reports.\n- An advanced rendering API designed for compatibility with optimization mods and graphics overhaul mods.\n\nAlso check out [Fabric Loader](https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric-loader), the (mostly) version-independent mod loader that powers Fabric. Fabric API is a mod like any other Fabric mod which requires Fabric Loader to be installed.\n\nFor support and discussion for both developers and users, visit [the Fabric Discord server](https://discord.gg/v6v4pMv).\n\n## Using Fabric API to play with mods\n\nMake sure you have install fabric loader first. More information about installing Fabric Loader can be found [here](https://fabricmc.net/use/).\n\nThe downloaded jar file should be placed in your `mods` folder.",

          "body": "![Requires Fabric API](https://cdn.imb11.dev/requires_fabric_api.png) [![IMB11 Discord server](https://cdn.imb11.dev/mineblock%20badge_64h.png)](https://discord.imb11.dev/) [![Steve's Underwater Paradise - Steveplays' Discord server](https://cdn.imb11.dev/steve.png)](https://discord.gg/KbWxgGg)\n\n# Fog\n\nAs it says on the tin - Fog is a mod that completely revamps how Minecraft handles fog, including its color, start, and end points. It creates a greater sense of depth and atmosphere in Minecraft by shifting the fog start forward, maintaining the same view distance while greatly improving the visuals of the game.\n\n## Features\n\nIt should be noted that the majority of these features can be fully customized via the configuration screen or resource packs - if you're using Fabric, you will need Mod Menu to access the configuration screen.\n\n### Cave Fog\n\nAs you go deeper underground, the fog gets thicker. This adds to the spooky and mysterious feel of caves, making exploration more intense and immersive. It helps create a sense of depth, making the underground environment feel more alive and engaging.\n\n![Cave Fog comparison (left: Mod Disabled; right: Mod Enabled)](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/WuGVWUF2/images/4c298cc1a03e59f9b9c1a5d587a4204cae504a39.png)\n\n### Weather Fog\n\nThe fog adjusts with the weather, so during rain or snow, the fog will change accordingly. This adds to the overall atmosphere, making each weather condition feel distinct and visually appealing.\n\n![Weather Fog comparison (left: Mod Disabled; right: Mod Enabled)](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/WuGVWUF2/images/f1ccdd8276b7412e343c70bedec36fb7bd255c0d.png)\n\n### Time-Based Haze\n\nFog becomes more colorful and vibrant during sunsets, sunrises, and nighttime. This feature enhances the beauty of these moments, providing stunning visuals and a more dynamic environment that changes with the time of day.\n\n![Time-Based Haze comparison (left: Mod Disabled; right: Mod Enabled)](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/WuGVWUF2/images/9813abf2da44ebb8a617896299497abd989888af.png)\n\n### Biome Fog Colors\n\nFog changes color based on the biome you're in, giving each area a unique look and feel. This helps create a coherent visual experience as you move through different biomes. It supports modded biomes and is easy to customize using resource packs, allowing for a highly personalized game experience.\n\n![Biome Fog Colors comparison (left: Mod Disabled; right: Mod Enabled)](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/WuGVWUF2/images/8cd00399374a9495f8f7ee3188cc76767db61a0b.png)\n\n### Sky Fixes\n\nWhen flying with an elytra above the clouds, the fog gradually fades away, offering a clear view of the sky without any strange horizon lines.\n\nAdditionally, clouds maintain their natural look and are not affected by fog color, ensuring they always appear consistent and visually appealing.\n\n![Sky Fixes comparison (left: Mod Disabled; right: Mod Enabled)](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/WuGVWUF2/images/5eb2c55f853792271abb509ba853dbbad6e4fdf4.png)\n\n## Dependencies\n\n### Required\n\n- [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api)\n- [YetAnotherConfigLib](https://modrinth.com/mod/yacl)\n\n## Compatibility info\n\n### Compatible mods\n\n- [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu): allows access to the configuration screen\n- [Sodium](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium): fully compatible, ensuring that your visuals remain consistent even with performance-enhancing mods\n- Shaders that use Minecraft’s default fog settings: fully compatible\n- [Distant Horizons](https://modrinth.com/mod/distanthorizons): planned for the future\n\n### Incompatibilities\n\nSee the [issue tracker](https://github.com/IMB11/Fog/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc+label%3Acompat)\nfor a list of incompatibilities.\n\n## Download\n\nFog is available for Forge on 1.20.1, and Fabric and NeoForge for 1.20.1, 1.20.4, 1.20.6 and 1.21.  \nYou can download Fog from the following locations:\n\n- [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/IMB11/Fog/releases)\n- [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/fog)\n- [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fog)\n\n## FAQ\n\n- Q: Will you be backporting this mod to lower Minecraft versions?  \n  > No - it takes too much time and effort to backport to older versions, and it's not worth the time investment as very little of the community is on those versions.\n\n\n- Q: Will you be supporting Forge for 1.20.4+?\n  > No, you should consider moving to the [NeoForge](https://neoforged.net) mod loader.\n\n\n- Q: Do you support Quilt?\n  > Unfortunately, we are unable to provide support for issues arising from attempting to use this mod with Quilt - you are welcome to try to use it **at your own risk.**\n\n\n- Q: Does this mod work in multiplayer?  \n  > Yes! This mod is fully multiplayer compatible - only clients need to have the mod installed, but if your friends have the mod installed, you should have similar visuals.\n\n\n- Q: Does only the client need this mod or does the server need it too?  \n  > This is a completely client side mod, so only the client needs to have it installed. The server does not need to have it installed.\n\n### For Developers and Server Admins\n\nIf you want to add support for your modded biomes, you can utilize Fog's custom JSON fog definition format to create unique fog effects. The mod is fully customizable via resource packs and a dedicated configuration file.\n\nFurthermore, if you're developing a Fabric mod, you can utilize Fog's custom datagen providers to speed your development workflow up when adding compatability with the mod.\n\nServer owners can adjust fog start/end points and biome colors to match their server's aesthetic.\n\n**For more information, check out Fog's [documentation](https://docs.imb11.dev/fog/).**\n\n## License\n\nThis project is licensed under All Rights Reserved, see [LICENSE](https://github.com/IMB11/Fog/blob/master/LICENSE).\n\n## Attribution\n\n- [birsy](https://modrinth.com/user/birsy), the original author of [Fog Looks Good Now](https://modrinth.com/mod/fog-looks-good-now) - many of the systems and ideas were expanded from this mod.\n- [Steveplays](https://modrinth.com/user/Steveplays), the author of the [Biome Fog](https://modrinth.com/mod/biomefog) mod - who collaborated with me to bring biome fog colors to Fog.\n",

zoom mod with infinite customizability.*\n\nZoomify aims to provide the easiest, most configurable and most sexy looking zoom mod you will ever find.\n\n![Zoom Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isXander/Zoomify/1.19/screenshots/zoom-example.gif)\n\n[![](https://www.bisecthosting.com/partners/custom-banners/08bbd3ff-5c0d-4480-8738-de0f070a04dd.png)](https://bisecthosting.com/xander)\n\n</center></div>\n\n## How to use\n### Keybind\nInitially, Minecraft has a keybind that overrides Zoomify by default.\nGo to the controls menu and make sure the Zoomify keybind (default `C`)\nisn't conflicting (goes red).\n\n### Open settings menu\nYou can access the settings menu with two ways.\n\n- The client command `/zoomify`\n- [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu) settings button\n\n## Features\n### Scroll Zoom\nYou can zoom in further using your scroll wheel.\n\n![Scroll Zoom Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isXander/Zoomify/1.19/screenshots/scroll-zoom-example.gif)\n\n### Spyglass Integration\nYou can configure Zoomify to only be able to zoom in when you are holding or carrying a spyglass.\nOr even just override the spyglass zoom with Zoomify!\n\nShow the spyglass overlay and play spyglass sound effects when using Zoomify.\n\n![Spyglass Integration Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isXander/Zoomify/1.19/screenshots/spyglass-integration-example.gif)\n\n### Transitions\n**14 different** transitions to choose from!\n\n- Instant\n- Linear\n- [Ease in Sine](https://easings.net/#easeInSine)\n- [Ease out Sine](https://easings.net/#easeOutSine)\n- [Ease in/out Sine](https://easings.net/#easeInOutSine)\n- [Ease in Quad](https://easings.net/#easeInQuad)\n- [Ease out Quad](https://easings.net/#easeOutQuad)\n- [Ease in/out Quad](https://easings.net/#easeInOutQuad)\n- [Ease in Cubic](https://easings.net/#easeInCubic)\n- [Ease out Cubic](https://easings.net/#easeOutCubic)\n- [Ease in/out Cubic](https://easings.net/#easeInOutCubic)\n- [Ease in Exponential](https://easings.net/#easeInExp)\n- [Ease out Exponential](https://easings.net/#easeOutExp)\n- [Ease in/out Exponential](https://easings.net/#easeInOutExp)\n\nYou can even pick what transition you would like for zooming in and out individually!\n\n![Individual Transition Config](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isXander/Zoomify/1.19/screenshots/individual-transition.png)\n\n### Relative Sensitivity\nReduce your mouse sensitivity based on the amount of zoom,\nso you have fine control over your player.\n\n![Relative Sensitivity Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isXander/Zoomify/1.19/screenshots/relative-sensitivity-example.gif)\n\n### Relative View Bobbing\nReduce the view bobbing effect based on the amount of zoom,\nso you can walk and zoom at the same time!\n\n![Relative View Bobbing Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isXander/Zoomify/1.19/screenshots/relative-view-bobbing-example.gif)\n\n### Cinematic Camera\nMake the mouse/camera smooth, like the zoom in [OptiFine](https://www.optifine.net).\n\n![Cinematic Cam Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isXander/Zoomify/1.19/screenshots/cinematic-cam-example.gif)\n\n### Affect Hand FOV\nTurn off this setting to prevent your hand from also being zoomed in!\n\n![Affect Hand FOV Turned Off Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isXander/Zoomify/1.19/screenshots/affect-hand-fov-disabled-example.gif)\n\n### Secondary Zoom\n\nCompletely separate zoom from normal Zoomify.\nAimed for content creators, features `Hide HUD While Zooming` option and longer zoom in times.\n\n![Secondary Zoom Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isXander/Zoomify/1.19/screenshots/secondary-zoom.gif)\n\n### Presets\n\nYou can reset to default, make Zoomify behave like OptiFine and others!\n\n### Smart Keybinding Detection\n\nOn first launch, if a keybinding is conflicting with Zoomify's zoom, a notification will appear notifying them of this.\n\n![Keybinding Conflict Detection](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isXander/Zoomify/1.19/screenshots/keybind-conflict-detection.png)\n\n### Highly configurable\nAbsolutely **NO** hard-coded values. Everything about your zoom is configurable!\n\n### Control the zoom speed with seconds\nInstead of some stupid arbitrary value such as zoom speed, you can pick\nthe exact amount of seconds it will take to zoom in, with a separate setting for zooming out.\n\n### Credits\n- [Xander](https://github.com/isXander) - Developer\n- [MoonTidez](https://github.com/MoonTidez) - Logo designer\n\n#### Translators\nLanguages in alphabetical order\n\n- [神枪968](https://github.com/GodGun968) - 简体中文 / Chinese (Simplified)\n- [Xander](https://github.com/isXander) - English (United Kingdom)\n- [Madis0](https://github.com/Madis0) - eesti keel / Estonian\n- [co-91](https://github.com/co-91) - 日本語 / Japanese\n- [Rodrigo Appelt](https://github.com/Agentew04) - Português / Portuguese\n- [SyberiaK](https://github.com/SyberiaK) - Русский / Russian\n- [Felix14-v2](https://github.com/Felix14-v2) - Русский / Russian\n- [Zetsphiron](https://github.com/Zetsphiron) - Español (mexicano) / Spanish (Mexico)\n- [Zetsphiron](https://github.com/Zetsphiron) - Español (españa) / Spanish (Spain)\n- [localfossa](https://github.com/localfossa) - Türkçe / Turkish\n- [Im Vietnam](https://github.com/ImVietnam) - Tiếng Việt / Vietnamese\n",
