IMPORTANCE NOTE: Antique Atlas has an incompatibility with Nvidium. To put it short, AA has a bug on multiplayer by not loading new chunks. Please turn off Async BFS in Nvidium if you have an Nvidia GPU. I am unable to change this in the default settings on my own since i dont use an Nvidia GPU. Thank you for your cooperation. ^w^

Embark on your adventure today, and let the stars guide you!
